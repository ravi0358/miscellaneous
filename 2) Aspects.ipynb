Cisco  Unified  Communications  Manager  is  possibly  the  most  widely  used  IT  infrastructure  solution  across  our  company  by  far.  We  started  deploying  it  modestly,  in  2004,  for  a  small  portion  of  our  users  in  one  department,  and  for  some  IT  users.  Since  then,  we  started  to  increase  the  adoption,  mostly  when  we  had  new  departments  or  office  layout  changes,  where  it  was  easier  and  cheaper  to  deploy.  At  some  port,  we  also  started  to  deploy  it  in  remote  sites,  across  the  globe.  That  movement  allowed  us  to  have  a  seamless  phone  experience  and  allowed  our  users  to  communicate  across  the  globe.  The  US  office  could  easily  call  HQ  in  Brazil  without  any  cost  per  minute.  That  was  a  game-changer  and  allowed  us  to  promote  more  with  fast  communication  between  offices.  At  some  point,  we  decided  to  replace  all  the  old  TDM  PBXs  and  that  bunch  of  cables  for  the  small  and  simple  UCS  servers.  Besides  the  fact  that  it  saved  a  lot  of  real  estate  in  our  datacenter  also  saved  us  time  by  letting  us  administer  on  a  single  console.

Each  employee  has  access  to  this  software. \"It s\",  really  helpful  in  daily  operation  to  get  quick  information  by  simply  sending  messages  to  co-workers  but  when  we  compare  with  other  alternative  available  in  the  market  like  Skype,  Microsoft  Teams,  it  really  needs  to  be  upgraded  up  to  the  mark. My Cisco Jabber Review.  We  used  Cisco  Jabber  across  the  whole  organization.  It  resolves  our  communication  and  collaboration  demands  globally,  especially  during  these  pandemic  times.  It  provides  us  the  flexibility  to  have  communication  regardless  if  it  is  on  laptop  or  desktop  or  mobile  phones.  It  is  also  compatible  on  all  known  types  of  operating  systems. Cisco Jabber Review.  We  deployed  Jabber  to  all  laptop  users  (~340,  company-wide)  before  the  government  announced  a  circuit  breaker  (stay-at-home  notice).  It  allows  users  who  are  working  remotely  to  remain  contactable  for  both  internal  colleagues  and  external  parties  which  is  important  for  collaboration  and  improves  productivity.  In  addition,  it  avoids  making  users  use  their  personal  mobile  phone  for  work,  which  would  incur  additional  costs  to  monthly  phone  bills. Cisco Jabber review. \"It s\",  being  used  by  those  who  no  longer  want  to  have  a  physical  phone  anymore.  It  is  also  helpful  in  the  security  aspect  in  that  it  takes  out  a  physical  device  on  the  network  that  can  be  a  point  on  compromise  and  where  we \"can t\",  push  updates  to  these  physical  phones  to  protect  them  from  being  a  target  for  attackers. Enterprise-integrated instant messaging.  Jabber  is  used  cross-organization,  though  primarily  by  office-based  staff  rather  than  front-line  workers. \"It s\",  used  primarily  for  desk-based  instant  messaging  including  group  conversations,  benefiting  from  integration  with  Microsoft  Office,  and  screen-sharing.  Officers  tend  to  use  the  tool  for  quick  queries  and  mini-conversations  which \"aren t\",  suited  to  email  (requiring  interactive  conversation)  but \"don t\",  necessitate  a  face-to-face  meeting \"(don t\",  take  up  much  time).  Some  workers  use  mobile  apps  to  continue  connectivity  while  away  from  desks,  but  this \"isn t\",  the  primary  use  in  our  organization. Jabber helps collaborate.  Jabber  is  used  across  our  entire  organization  as  the  primary  IM  and  Voice  tool.  We  utilize  it  for  joining  Webex  Meetings,  1  to  1  or  1  to  many  chats,  screen  sharing,  telephony  and  persistent  chat.  It  allows  users  to  seemlessly  join  Web  Ex  and  video  meetings  and  provides  an  on  prem  solution  from  a  security  perspective. Jabber.  We  use  Jabber  for  our  users  who  have  to  travel  frequently.  This  combined  with  remote  access  tools  for  their  computers  allows  them  to  work  completely  from  wherever  they  might  be.  This  helps  significantly  with  business  continuity  and  privacy  for  end-users  so  that  personal  cellular  numbers  do  not  need  to  be  used. Super easy to use and feature-rich.  We  use  it  for  inter  and  intraoffice  communication.  We  also  use  it  for  screen  sharing  and  presenting.  We  use  it  for  conference  calls.  We  have  used  it  for  file  sharing.  We  use  it  across  our  entire  organization.  Some  of  the  biggest  problems  it  addresses  it  allowing  for  quick  communication  between  staff  members,  in  addition  to  providing  presentation  capabilities  in  a  large  conference  room  when  a  senior  developer  needs  to  present  screens  for  demos  and  client  approval. Jabber for instant collaboration!.  Our  users  use  it  as  a  softphone  client  across  the  EHS  Department.  This  makes  our  life  easy  in  this  era  of  softphones.  It  addresses  our  future  of  standardizing  the  phone  client. Jabber, Cisco\\'s IM, presence, and softphone platform.  Jabber  is  one  of  two  solutions  we  use  for  collaboration  and  presence.  We  leverage  Jabber  both  in-office  and  on  our  mobile  devices  to  be  able  to  real-time  chat,  answer  our  desk  extensions,  determine  presence  and  availability  of  coworkers,  and  manage  our  Webex  Meetings  and  Personal  Rooms. Helping Communication.  We  use  Jabber  across  the  whole  organization.  Jabber  is  utilized  to  help  communicate  by  sending  a  message  to  another  associate  when  you  need  to  get  a  quicker  response.  It  helps  us  to  also  be  able  to  visually  share  information  by  file  sharing  and  actually  being  able  to  share  and  view  screens. It enables me to work remotely, just like I was in the office!. \"I m\",  the  only  remote  employee  at  my  organization,  so  the  one  that  leverages  Jabber  most  heavily,  but  it  is  available  for  all  employees  with  a  phone.  Jabber  enables  me  to  make  and  answer  calls  on  my  work  number  while \"I m\",  in  another  state. Instanlty collobaorate with Jabber!.  Certain  departments  are  using  Jabber.  I  think  Jabber  is  great  because \"it s\",  a  lot  like  a  messenger.

You  can  also  tell  if  an  employee  is  available,  in  a  meeting,  offline,  or  out  of  the  office. Cisco Jabber: Softphone solution on any device..  Cisco  Jabber  is  used  in  some  sectors  of  the  company.  Mainly  I  use  it  as  part  of  an  internal  call  center  since  it  is  a  much  simpler  telephone  with  a  headset  while  working.  In  addition,  on  the  same  platform,  I  can  chat  and  share  documentation  with  colleagues  even  while \"I m\",  on  a  call. Jabber for the Enterprise.  We  use  Jabber  as  our  main  instant  messaging  platform.  It  is  utilized  by  multiple  groups  within  our  organization,  including  IT  support,  retail  support,  ops  support,  and  marketing.  It  helps  us  to  multitask,  especially  during  phone  conferences  and  online  meetings. Awesome chat tool.  My  team  was  looking  for  a  easy  to  use  internal  chat  tool  that  would  help  us  speed  up  our  communication.  The  primary  idea  behind  looking  for  this  tool  was  to  eliminate  a  lot  of  redundant  emails  and  short  phone  calls.  Having  an  internal  chat  would  also  let  us  make  decisions  faster.  We  trialled  a  few  alternatives  and  finally  settled  on  Jabber.  It  is  now  currently  being  used  by  my  team.  Setting  it  up  was  really  simple,  we  were  able  to  get  users  on  to  it  and  create  groups  incredibly  quickly.  It  was  also  pretty  simple  to  use  so  we \"didn t\",  have  to  set  up  any  staff  training  to  get  users  into  it. Fantastic tool for internal communication. Strongly recommended..  Jabber  is  being  used  by  the  whole  organization,  across  all  departments.  It  makes  searching  and  communicating  with  other  colleagues  convenient.

This  is  extremely  helpful  when  your  user  wants  to  explain  something  to  colleagues  who  are  located  in  another  place. Stay connected and productive with Jabber.  We  use  Jabber  as  part  of  our  Cisco  Unified  Communications  package.  Jabber  is  primarily  used  for  intra-company  chat.  It  is  available  to  all  employees  and  connected  to  our  Active  Directory  and  integrated  with  Single  Sign-on.  For  this,  it  is  a  very  useful  tool.  It  is  also  integrated  with  our  Cisco  IP  telephony  system  to  allow  Vo  IP  calls,  even  when  away  from  the  office.  This  integration  also  allows  us  to  review  voicemail  and  do  screen-sharing  for  impromptu  meetings. Jabber is a useful tool.  It  is  used  as  an  inner  office  communication  tool.  It  cuts  down  on  emails  and  you  can  have  a  real-time  conversation  with  colleagues  while  still  working  at  your  desk. Jabber for Collaboration.  We  used  Jabber  as  our  enterprise  collaboration  solution.  During  my  time  at  a  prominent  healthcare  organization,  we  leveraged  Jabber  to  reduce  response  times,  allowing  problems,  incidents,  difficulties,  and  project  updated  to  be  communicated  quickly.  It  saved  time  and  cut  down  on  excessive  emails  since  we  could  ping  each  other  quickly.  The  video  chat  features  allowed  for  a  more  collaborative  meeting  experience  when  working  remotely  and  the  screen  share  features  allowed  us  in  IT  to  work  with  users  for  simple  issues.

Our  organization  managed  to  significantly  reduce  response  times,  allowing  problems,  incidents,  difficulties,  and  potential  and  progress  of  projects  to  be  addressed  immediately.  This  improvement  in  communication  time  has  allowed  us  to  improve  our  indices  of  profitability,  reduce  expenses,  and  optimization  our  business  processes. Must have jabber to save time.  We  are  using  Jabber  to  interact  with  our  teammates  and  ask  queries.  Also  we  have  an  office  in  the  US  and  they  are  using  Jabber  to  contact  us.  It  saves  a  lot  of  time  for  us.  We  can  also  send  screenshots  and  share  our  screen  with  the  help  of  Jabber.

Jabber  has  made  it  very  easy  to  call  contacts  and  chat/  message  at  the  same  time  within  the  interface. Quick Communication Can be easily made.  Jabber  is  a  good  tool  to  have  quick  communications.  It  is  a  tool  that  is  being  used  by  our  whole  organisation  (USA  office  and  India  office.)  In  our  integration  team,  we  get  the  quick  notification  through  Jabber  letting  us  know  what  is  a  priority,  and  which  customer  issues  need  to  solutions  ASAP. Communication with Freedom of Location.  We  are  in  the  process  of  rolling  out  Cisco  Jabber  to  our  enterprise  community.  We  have  been  piloting  it  for  quite  some  time  now  and  it  is  one  of  my  favorite  collaboration  tools  that  we  have  attempted  to  use  in  our  organization.  We  plan  to  provide  this  to  users  in  our  organization  that  currently  have  or  request  a  phone  line  for  business  purposes.  Our  users  will  have  the  flexibility  of  using  that  phone  line  on  either  a  Cisco  Jabber  client  or  on  the  client  and  a  physical  desk  phone.  The  problem  that  Cisco  Jabber  addresses  for  us  is  that  it  provides  the  ability  for  our  user  community  to  be  mobile  and  flexible  in  location  of  where  they  do  their  work  while  still  remaining  reachable  for  collaboration  with  others.  To  this  point  our  user  community  that  has  already  been  given  access  to  the  platform  is  very  satisfied  with  the  capability  to  communicate  with  the  tool.  Many  users  have  commented  to  us  that  they  wish  we  had  provided  this  capability  quite  some  time  ago.  Many  users  were  aware  that  the  product  existed  based  on  past  experience  with  another  employer  or  just  as  a  matter  of  having  researched  the  available  tools  for  collaboration  that  are  currently  popular. Great platform for interoffice communication.  Jabber  is  available  and  used  by  almost  everyone  in  our  organization.  It  is  used  to  communicate  between  staff  and  attorneys,  as  well  as  among  attorneys.  It  relieves  us  from  excessive  emails  and  allows  us  to  quickly  chat  on  work,  personal  and  other  matters  in  an  efficient  manner.  Our  only  problem  is  encouraging  more  people  to  use  it! Jabber at the Office.  Jabber  is  used  across  the  organization.  It  is  pretty  much  an  internal  communication  system  that  is  linked  to  the  telephone  system.  We  can  use  it  to  send  direct  and  instant  messages  (similar  to  a  chat  service),  make  phone  calls,  receive  calls,  send  and  receive  messages.  You  can  also  set  statuses  to  let  colleagues  know  if  you  are  available,  away,  busy,  or  on  the  line  with  someone  else. Great replacement for desk phones.  We  use  Jabber  across  the  enterprise.  In  order  to  reduce  hardware  and  licensing  costs,  we  needed  a  solution  that  replaced  our  existing  use  of  Skype  for  Business;  integrated  into  a  Cisco  Vo  IP  solution,  allowed  remote  users  to  be  issued  a  direct  number,  and  provided  simple,  straightforward  instant  messaging.  From  our  cost-benefit  analyses,  Jabber  was  significantly  cheaper  than  similar  solutions  from  Skype  for  Business  or  Citrix,  and  because  of  its  integration  into  the  Cisco  UCS  environment,  it  was  easy  to  deploy  out  the  enterprise. Jabbering Away on Cisco Jabber.  Jabber  is  currently  being  used  by  my  whole  organization  as  an  internal  instant  messaging  tool.  It  is  helpful  because  it  is  tied  to  our  phone  services  and  we  can  see  when  someone  is  in  a  meeting  or  not  without  opening  up  Outlook.  It  also  cuts  down  on  the  amount  of  emails  we  send  since  we  can  have  real-time  conversations  about  an  issue  or  use  it  to  answer  quick  questions  that \"don t\",  really  need  an  email.  It  makes  communication  easier  and  more  efficient. Jabber up a storm..  Jabber  was  implemented  once  the  product  became  a  more  mature  solution  to  our  collaboration  needs.  With  the  IP  communicator  product  being  phased  out  we  decided  to  standardize  on  Jabber.  The  main  focus  to  replace  the  softphone  features  but  also  now  with  its  added  functions  to  be  a  major  tool  in  our  collaboration  tool  chest.  It  is  now  being  used  also  for  sharing  and  chat  along  with  the  phone  functionality. Using Jabber to Blabber with your coworkers at a large non-profit.  Our  entire  organization  of  approximately  500-600  employees  uses  jabber  very  often  on  a  daily  basis  as  our  primary  means  of  instant  communication.  Besides  e-mail,  we  use  jabber  in  our  organization  to  ask  urgent  questions,  notify  others  of  things  quickly  or  send  more  informal  messages  that  don’t  require  a  full  email  or  phone  call.  It  allows  us  to  communicate  much  more  effectively  because  our  employees  are  usually  busy  and  not  confined  to  their  office  or  desk,  so  if  they  miss  a  phone  call  it  becomes  very  easy  to  play  phone  tag  all  day.  Jabber  is  also  a  more  casual  form  of  sending  messages  you  may  not  want  to  send  in  an  e-mail,  and  allows  you  to  use  emojis  and  attachments  to  illustrate  your  point. Dependable IP Telephone Access From Your Computer.  My  company  utilizes  Jabber  throughout  the  entire  organization.

Overall,  it  makes  office  communication  a  thousand  times  easier  and  more  efficient. Jabber keeps you connected when you move throughout the day.  As  far  as  I  know,  it  is  being  used  across  the  whole  organization.  Anyone  who  is  logged  into  a  computer  and  has  an  extension  is  able  to  use  it.  I  think  it  gives  more  means  of  communication  to  help  connect  the  campuses.  This  is  a  community  college  that  has  several  campuses  spread  out  across  central  PA,  so  having  varying  forms  of  communication  across  these  is  important.  It  also  helps  with  staff/faculty  who  move  offices  and  are  not  always  at  a  phone  with  their  extension.  They  are  able  to  use  Jabber  to  check  voicemail,  for  example. Cisco UC replacement of Avaya PBX.  We  replaced  our  Avaya  PBX  with  Cisco  VOIP  with  Jabber.  In  addition  to  replacing  PBX  infrastructure,  GWU  replaced  physical  hand  sets  with  soft  phone  Jabber  and  head  sets.

I  love  it! \"It s\",  a  quick  and  super  easy  way  to  communicate  with  managers  or  co-workers  if  I  have  a  quick  question  or  want  to  send  a  quick  comment.  The  best  part  about  this  is  that  it \"doesn t\",  bog  down  my  email  system  with  these  quick  little  comments  or  questions. \"There s\",  no  downside.  Love  it! Jabber has potential, but ....  In  my  previous  company,  we  used  Jabber  to  connect  all  employees  within  the  organization.  The  idea  was  to  have  easy  accessibility  to  all  employees  instantly.  Jabber  was  installed  on  all  machines  and  was  used  across  the  entire  organization.  With  Jabber  we  hoped  to  have  a  similar  interface  where  everyone  would  feel  comfortable  and  could  easily  see \"everyone s\",  status  (online/busy/meeting). Jabber - A No-Brainer!.

It  is  important  to  know  whether  or  not  a  person  is  available  based  on  their  presence.

We  also  use  the  share  desktop  feature  a  lot  to  collaborate  and  troubleshoot.  The  mobile  app  is  also  a  great  tool  for  reaching  others  when  there  are  after  hours  emergencies.  This  tool  is  used  throughout  the  company. Jabber- Great for Messaging and Desktop Sharing.  Jabber  is  being  used  as  our \"company s\",  instant  messaging  tool,  connecting  team,  departments,  and  the  entire  organization  in  a  useful  alternative  to  email.  Like  email  it  provides  an  asynchronous  means  of  sending  and  receiving  messages  in  a  less  disruptive  manner  than  phone,  or  face  to  face  conversations.  Additionally  with  the  availability  status  it  is  easy  to  know  if  a  coworker  is  in  the  office.

Jabber  has  been  deployed  for  all  of  our  users  across  the  entire  organization  on  their  desktop/laptop  machines  for  just  over  two  years  now.  Initially,  we  installed  Jabber  because  it  was \"Cisco s\",  upgrade  to  the  old  soft-phones  (PC  phones)  for  their  Call  Manager  (now  Unified  Communications)  system.  Jabber  would  allow  our  users  to  VPN  back  to  our  office  and  use  the  Jabber  client  like  it  was  their  office  phone,  so  their  clients  could  dial  their  office  number  and  reach  them,  dialing  out  would  show  their  office  number  on  caller  ID,  etc.  It  has  other  features  of  course,  but  this  was  our  primary  reason  for  using  Jabber.

Associates  use  the  Instant  Messaging/Chat  tool  to  collaborate  with  colleagues  who  are  online.  Associates  and  partners  use  the  Cisco  phone  features  to  stay  connected  when  they  are  out  of  the  office,  providing  seamless  access  to  clients.  I  use  all  the  tools.  I  especially  appreciate  the  phone  connectivity  because  I  can  make  a  call  to  one  of  our  international  offices  without  having  to  dial  international  calling  codes,  etc.  I  simply  use  our  internal  IP  phone  exchanges,  and  I  can  call  another  office  very  easily  especially  when  I  am  at  home. Best Video Conference tool.  We  use  Jabber  across  our  enterprise  and  we  use  it  for  video  conferencing.  This  helps  us  connect  easily  as  our  team  is  spread  across  the  country.

The  most  beneficial  use  of  Jabber  that  we  have  been  using  is  to  connect  our  survey  crews  that  are  on  client  sites  with  project  managers.  We  are  using  Jabber  across  multiple  devices  using  file  sharing,  video,  voice  and  chat.  It  is  making  a  huge  difference  in  the  efficiency  of  sharing  valuable  site  information  in  real-time.  While  we  are  still  getting  everyone  into  the  habit  of  adopting  this  new  system,  we  know  it  will  be  a  game  changer  for  our  company.

I  even  hold  training  sessions  for  colleagues  via  Cisco  Webex  Meetings.The  reason,  except  for  COVID  reasons,  I  use  Cisco  Webex  Meetings  so  much  is  that  I  work  from  home.

We  now  have  just  this  one  as  the  primary  source  for  all  the  people  in  the  business  and  as  users  have  been  using  it  more  they  are  dropping  our  older  technologies  like  Skype  for  Business  and  Teams  and  switching  to  Webex  Meetings  for  all  their  conferencing  needs. Webex is #1 in my book!.  I  started  using  the  personal  one  when  my  company \"wasn t\",  interested  in  Webex  because  of  the  pricing.  Since  we  negotiated  our  new  maintenance  contracts,  we  were  able  to  slip  some  money  in  to  purchase  some  licenses.  We  have  just  begun  implementing  it  internally  with  our  organization.  We  had  been  using  on-prem  Skype  but  we  received  too  many  complaints  about  choppy  calls  and  not  being  able  to  share  documents.  I  have  had  no  issues  with  my  personal  Webex  account  and  championed  it  for  purchase  by  the  company. Cisco WebEx: my go-to collaboration tool when I can\\'t always be on the go.

Webex Meetings for a company of 60.  Our  company  is  using  Web  Ex  Meetings  as  our  video  conferencing  service.  We  have  moved  everyone  in  our  company  to  remote  work  during  this  time  of  COVID-19  and  have  begun  to  utilize  it  even  more  than  before  by  using  personal  rooms,  teams,  and  all  staff  video  meetings.  We  tend  to  run  into  bandwidth  issues  when  we  have  all  60  employees  on  a  video  meeting  but  when  it  is  a  smaller  group,  it  seems  to  work  fine.

Each  employee  has  access  to  this  software. \"It s\",  really  helpful  in  daily  operation  to  get  quick  information  by  simply  sending  messages  to  co-workers  but  when  we  compare  with  other  alternative  available  in  the  market  like  Skype,  Microsoft  Teams,  it  really  needs  to  be  upgraded  up  to  the  mark. My Cisco Jabber Review.  We  used  Cisco  Jabber  across  the  whole  organization.  It  resolves  our  communication  and  collaboration  demands  globally,  especially  during  these  pandemic  times.  It  provides  us  the  flexibility  to  have  communication  regardless  if  it  is  on  laptop  or  desktop  or  mobile  phones.  It  is  also  compatible  on  all  known  types  of  operating  systems. Cisco Jabber Review.  We  deployed  Jabber  to  all  laptop  users  (~340,  company-wide)  before  the  government  announced  a  circuit  breaker  (stay-at-home  notice).  It  allows  users  who  are  working  remotely  to  remain  contactable  for  both  internal  colleagues  and  external  parties  which  is  important  for  collaboration  and  improves  productivity.  In  addition,  it  avoids  making  users  use  their  personal  mobile  phone  for  work,  which  would  incur  additional  costs  to  monthly  phone  bills. Cisco Jabber review. \"It s\",  being  used  by  those  who  no  longer  want  to  have  a  physical  phone  anymore.  It  is  also  helpful  in  the  security  aspect  in  that  it  takes  out  a  physical  device  on  the  network  that  can  be  a  point  on  compromise  and  where  we \"can t\",  push  updates  to  these  physical  phones  to  protect  them  from  being  a  target  for  attackers. Enterprise-integrated instant messaging.  Jabber  is  used  cross-organization,  though  primarily  by  office-based  staff  rather  than  front-line  workers. \"It s\",  used  primarily  for  desk-based  instant  messaging  including  group  conversations,  benefiting  from  integration  with  Microsoft  Office,  and  screen-sharing.  Officers  tend  to  use  the  tool  for  quick  queries  and  mini-conversations  which \"aren t\",  suited  to  email  (requiring  interactive  conversation)  but \"don t\",  necessitate  a  face-to-face  meeting \"(don t\",  take  up  much  time).  Some  workers  use  mobile  apps  to  continue  connectivity  while  away  from  desks,  but  this \"isn t\",  the  primary  use  in  our  organization. Jabber helps collaborate.  Jabber  is  used  across  our  entire  organization  as  the  primary  IM  and  Voice  tool.  We  utilize  it  for  joining  Webex  Meetings,  1  to  1  or  1  to  many  chats,  screen  sharing,  telephony  and  persistent  chat.  It  allows  users  to  seemlessly  join  Web  Ex  and  video  meetings  and  provides  an  on  prem  solution  from  a  security  perspective. Jabber.  We  use  Jabber  for  our  users  who  have  to  travel  frequently.  This  combined  with  remote  access  tools  for  their  computers  allows  them  to  work  completely  from  wherever  they  might  be.  This  helps  significantly  with  business  continuity  and  privacy  for  end-users  so  that  personal  cellular  numbers  do  not  need  to  be  used. Super easy to use and feature-rich.  We  use  it  for  inter  and  intraoffice  communication.  We  also  use  it  for  screen  sharing  and  presenting.  We  use  it  for  conference  calls.  We  have  used  it  for  file  sharing.  We  use  it  across  our  entire  organization.  Some  of  the  biggest  problems  it  addresses  it  allowing  for  quick  communication  between  staff  members,  in  addition  to  providing  presentation  capabilities  in  a  large  conference  room  when  a  senior  developer  needs  to  present  screens  for  demos  and  client  approval. Jabber for instant collaboration!.  Our  users  use  it  as  a  softphone  client  across  the  EHS  Department.  This  makes  our  life  easy  in  this  era  of  softphones.  It  addresses  our  future  of  standardizing  the  phone  client. Jabber, Cisco\\'s IM, presence, and softphone platform.  Jabber  is  one  of  two  solutions  we  use  for  collaboration  and  presence.

Helping Communication.  We  use  Jabber  across  the  whole  organization.

It  helps  us  to  also  be  able  to  visually  share  information  by  file  sharing  and  actually  being  able  to  share  and  view  screens. It enables me to work remotely, just like I was in the office!. \"I m\",  the  only  remote  employee  at  my  organization,  so  the  one  that  leverages  Jabber  most  heavily,  but  it  is  available  for  all  employees  with  a  phone.  Jabber  enables  me  to  make  and  answer  calls  on  my  work  number  while \"I m\",  in  another  state. Instanlty collobaorate with Jabber!.  Certain  departments  are  using  Jabber.

You  can  call  from  Jabber,  listen  to  voice  mails,  chat,  set  up  groups,  insert  files,  share  your  screen  and  much  more.  You  can  also  tell  if  an  employee  is  available,  in  a  meeting,  offline,  or  out  of  the  office. Cisco Jabber: Softphone solution on any device..  Cisco  Jabber  is  used  in  some  sectors  of  the  company.  Mainly  I  use  it  as  part  of  an  internal  call  center  since  it  is  a  much  simpler  telephone  with  a  headset  while  working.  In  addition,  on  the  same  platform,  I  can  chat  and  share  documentation  with  colleagues  even  while \"I m\",  on  a  call. Jabber for the Enterprise.  We  use  Jabber  as  our  main  instant  messaging  platform.  It  is  utilized  by  multiple  groups  within  our  organization,  including  IT  support,  retail  support,  ops  support,  and  marketing.  It  helps  us  to  multitask,  especially  during  phone  conferences  and  online  meetings. Awesome chat tool.  My  team  was  looking  for  a  easy  to  use  internal  chat  tool  that  would  help  us  speed  up  our  communication.  The  primary  idea  behind  looking  for  this  tool  was  to  eliminate  a  lot  of  redundant  emails  and  short  phone  calls.  Having  an  internal  chat  would  also  let  us  make  decisions  faster.  We  trialled  a  few  alternatives  and  finally  settled  on  Jabber.  It  is  now  currently  being  used  by  my  team.  Setting  it  up  was  really  simple,  we  were  able  to  get  users  on  to  it  and  create  groups  incredibly  quickly.  It  was  also  pretty  simple  to  use  so  we \"didn t\",  have  to  set  up  any  staff  training  to  get  users  into  it. Fantastic tool for internal communication. Strongly recommended..  Jabber  is  being  used  by  the  whole  organization,  across  all  departments.  It  makes  searching  and  communicating  with  other  colleagues  convenient.  The  software  allows  texting,  calling,  as  well  as  sharing  files  and  current  screens.  This  is  extremely  helpful  when  your  user  wants  to  explain  something  to  colleagues  who  are  located  in  another  place. Stay connected and productive with Jabber.  We  use  Jabber  as  part  of  our  Cisco  Unified  Communications  package.  Jabber  is  primarily  used  for  intra-company  chat.  It  is  available  to  all  employees  and  connected  to  our  Active  Directory  and  integrated  with  Single  Sign-on.  For  this,  it  is  a  very  useful  tool.  It  is  also  integrated  with  our  Cisco  IP  telephony  system  to  allow  Vo  IP  calls,  even  when  away  from  the  office.  This  integration  also  allows  us  to  review  voicemail  and  do  screen-sharing  for  impromptu  meetings. Jabber is a useful tool.  It  is  used  as  an  inner  office  communication  tool.  It  cuts  down  on  emails  and  you  can  have  a  real-time  conversation  with  colleagues  while  still  working  at  your  desk. Jabber for Collaboration.  We  used  Jabber  as  our  enterprise  collaboration  solution.  During  my  time  at  a  prominent  healthcare  organization,  we  leveraged  Jabber  to  reduce  response  times,  allowing  problems,  incidents,  difficulties,  and  project  updated  to  be  communicated  quickly.  It  saved  time  and  cut  down  on  excessive  emails  since  we  could  ping  each  other  quickly.  The  video  chat  features  allowed  for  a  more  collaborative  meeting  experience  when  working  remotely  and  the  screen  share  features  allowed  us  in  IT  to  work  with  users  for  simple  issues. Jabber is an ideal program for internal communications of organizations..  Jabber  coordinates  the \"company s\",  operations  to  achieve  a  more  assertive  line  of  communication.  Jabber  gives  our  organization  better  communication  mechanisms,  not  to  mention  fast  response  times.  Our  organization  managed  to  significantly  reduce  response  times,  allowing  problems,  incidents,  difficulties,  and  potential  and  progress  of  projects  to  be  addressed  immediately.  This  improvement  in  communication  time  has  allowed  us  to  improve  our  indices  of  profitability,  reduce  expenses,  and  optimization  our  business  processes. Must have jabber to save time.  We  are  using  Jabber  to  interact  with  our  teammates  and  ask  queries.  Also  we  have  an  office  in  the  US  and  they  are  using  Jabber  to  contact  us.  It  saves  a  lot  of  time  for  us.  We  can  also  send  screenshots  and  share  our  screen  with  the  help  of  Jabber.  Jabber  also  shows  the  status  of  the  person,  for  example  that  he  is  in  a  meeting  or  away  at  that  time.  So  I  will  recommend  Jabber  to  everyone,  because  it  a  useful  and  time  saving  software. Jabber - Straight forward and great for a company small or large.

Communication with Freedom of Location.  We  are  in  the  process  of  rolling  out  Cisco  Jabber  to  our  enterprise  community.  We  have  been  piloting  it  for  quite  some  time  now  and  it  is  one  of  my  favorite  collaboration  tools  that  we  have  attempted  to  use  in  our  organization.  We  plan  to  provide  this  to  users  in  our  organization  that  currently  have  or  request  a  phone  line  for  business  purposes.  Our  users  will  have  the  flexibility  of  using  that  phone  line  on  either  a  Cisco  Jabber  client  or  on  the  client  and  a  physical  desk  phone.  The  problem  that  Cisco  Jabber  addresses  for  us  is  that  it  provides  the  ability  for  our  user  community  to  be  mobile  and  flexible  in  location  of  where  they  do  their  work  while  still  remaining  reachable  for  collaboration  with  others.  To  this  point  our  user  community  that  has  already  been  given  access  to  the  platform  is  very  satisfied  with  the  capability  to  communicate  with  the  tool.  Many  users  have  commented  to  us  that  they  wish  we  had  provided  this  capability  quite  some  time  ago.  Many  users  were  aware  that  the  product  existed  based  on  past  experience  with  another  employer  or  just  as  a  matter  of  having  researched  the  available  tools  for  collaboration  that  are  currently  popular. Great platform for interoffice communication.  Jabber  is  available  and  used  by  almost  everyone  in  our  organization.

You  can  also  set  statuses  to  let  colleagues  know  if  you  are  available,  away,  busy,  or  on  the  line  with  someone  else. Great replacement for desk phones.  We  use  Jabber  across  the  enterprise.  In  order  to  reduce  hardware  and  licensing  costs,  we  needed  a  solution  that  replaced  our  existing  use  of  Skype  for  Business;  integrated  into  a  Cisco  Vo  IP  solution,  allowed  remote  users  to  be  issued  a  direct  number,  and  provided  simple,  straightforward  instant  messaging.  From  our  cost-benefit  analyses,  Jabber  was  significantly  cheaper  than  similar  solutions  from  Skype  for  Business  or  Citrix,  and  because  of  its  integration  into  the  Cisco  UCS  environment,  it  was  easy  to  deploy  out  the  enterprise.

It  allows  us  to  communicate  much  more  effectively  because  our  employees  are  usually  busy  and  not  confined  to  their  office  or  desk,  so  if  they  miss  a  phone  call  it  becomes  very  easy  to  play  phone  tag  all  day.  Jabber  is  also  a  more  casual  form  of  sending  messages  you  may  not  want  to  send  in  an  e-mail,  and  allows  you  to  use  emojis  and  attachments  to  illustrate  your  point.

I  think  it  gives  more  means  of  communication  to  help  connect  the  campuses.  This  is  a  community  college  that  has  several  campuses  spread  out  across  central  PA,  so  having  varying  forms  of  communication  across  these  is  important.  It  also  helps  with  staff/faculty  who  move  offices  and  are  not  always  at  a  phone  with  their  extension.  They  are  able  to  use  Jabber  to  check  voicemail,  for  example.

We  also  use  the  share  desktop  feature  a  lot  to  collaborate  and  troubleshoot.  The  mobile  app  is  also  a  great  tool  for  reaching  others  when  there  are  after  hours  emergencies.  This  tool  is  used  throughout  the  company.

Initially,  we  installed  Jabber  because  it  was \"Cisco s\",  upgrade  to  the  old  soft-phones  (PC  phones)  for  their  Call  Manager  (now  Unified  Communications)  system.  Jabber  would  allow  our  users  to  VPN  back  to  our  office  and  use  the  Jabber  client  like  it  was  their  office  phone,  so  their  clients  could  dial  their  office  number  and  reach  them,  dialing  out  would  show  their  office  number  on  caller  ID,  etc.  It  has  other  features  of  course,  but  this  was  our  primary  reason  for  using  Jabber.

Associates  use  the  Instant  Messaging/Chat  tool  to  collaborate  with  colleagues  who  are  online.  Associates  and  partners  use  the  Cisco  phone  features  to  stay  connected  when  they  are  out  of  the  office,  providing  seamless  access  to  clients.  I  use  all  the  tools.  I  especially  appreciate  the  phone  connectivity  because  I  can  make  a  call  to  one  of  our  international  offices  without  having  to  dial  international  calling  codes,  etc.  I  simply  use  our  internal  IP  phone  exchanges,  and  I  can  call  another  office  very  easily  especially  when  I  am  at  home.

We  are  using  Jabber  across  multiple  devices  using  file  sharing,  video,  voice  and  chat.  It  is  making  a  huge  difference  in  the  efficiency  of  sharing  valuable  site  information  in  real-time.

Jabber  served  as  an  efficient  platform  for  establishing  messages  as  well  as  connecting  seamlessly  to  all  of  our  work  schedules,  cell  phones,  and  e-calendars.  It  was  useful  for  identifying  if  co-workers  were  at  work  that  particular  day  or  in  a  meeting  or  maybe  even  just  away  from  their  computer  for  a  bit. Our go-to solution for chats, voice and video calls.  All  employees  worldwide  in  our  company  use  Jabber.  Jabber  has  a  found  a  sweet  spot  between  e-mails  and  phone  calls. \"It s\",  faster  to  contact  someone  through  Jabber,  and  less  formal,  than  it  would  be  with  an  e-mail.  On  the  other  hand,  receiving  a  Jabber  message  is  less  disruptive  for  the  recipient  than  receiving  a  phone  call.  We  routinely  use  Jabber  for  instant  and  informal  discussions  with  colleagues  anywhere  in  the  world.  Jabber  is  also  providing  telephony  and  video  conference  capability  over  IP,  integrating  with  Cisco  IP  telephony. Jabber utilization to replace other VoIP interfaces.  As  our  company  continues  to  move  to  more  of  a  remote  employee  mindset,  this  tool  helps  individuals  to  easily  utilize  Vo  IP  phones  with  the  user  interface.  If  we  did  not  have  this  software  we  could  possibly  have  to  have  phones  at  each  of  the  work-from-home  individuals  desks.  Our  company  originally  was  using  Cisco  IP  Communicator.  This  software  was  not  as  seamless  and  did  not  offer  as  many  options  as  Jabber  does,  for  example  the  video  conferencing  on  Jabber  allows  our  remote  workers  to  communicate  in  a  much  more  efficient  manner  with  ease.  We  have  seen  an  increase  in  collaboration  among  our  scrumteams  with  the  use  of  Jabber  video  conferencing. A day with Jabber.

We  use  Jabber  as  an  audio  tool  for  connecting  to  our  IP  phones  within  the  organization.  For  the  employees  that  for  example  work  from  home  and  they  can  use  Jabber  as  a  normal  phone  system  and  not  have  to  a  land  line.  This  is  great  product  for  seamlessly  connecting  to  conference  calls  and  managing  calls  throughout  the  work  day. Cisco Jabber as an inter-agency communication platform.  We  use  Jabber  for  inter-agency  communications  and  certain  agencies  also  use  its  soft  phone  capacity  with  call  manager.

We  are  currently  looking  at  ways  to  integrate  and  use  it  concurrently  with  Skype  for  Business. Connecting cloud teams..  Jabber  is  the  communication  lifeline  for  our  company,  where  we  operate  in  the  cloud  and  have  teams  dispersed  across  the  globe.  It  is  less  obtrusive  than  a  phone  call  and  75%  of  the  time  you  know  your  colleague  is  online  and  ready  to  respond  to  a  quick  question. Choose Slack!.  We  use  Jabber  as  the  main  communication  tool  across  the  whole  company,  and  it  solves  the  basic  need  of  sending  messages  (and  sometimes  making  calls).  However,  while  Jabber  technically  gets  the  job  done,  I  definitely \"wouldn t\",  recommend  it  over  Slack  or  even  Skype... \"it s\",  just  not  as  nice!  As  a  product  designer,  Slack  constantly  delights  me  with  thoughtfully  designed  interfaces  and  features  whereas  Jabber  is  just  a  chore  to  use. \"It s\",  not  very  pretty,  and  so  many  UX  and  UI  things  just \"don t\",  work  the  way \"you d\",  think  they  should. Jabber rocks!.  Jabber  is  used  across  the  organization  on  both  PC  and  mobility  platforms.  We  use  it  for  collaboration  in  chat  and  soft  phone.  There  is  a  lot  savings  for  our  mobility  users  who  travel  internationally  when  they  make  calls  over  Jabber  versus  a  cellular  network. Jabber plays well with others and is a pleasure to have in class..  Jabber  is  being  used  as  our  Unified  Communications  platform;  however  it  is  still  in  the  infancy  phases  of  deployment.  We  are  actively  testing  other  platforms  for  unified  communications  /  desktop  sharing  /  desk  top  video  /  and  general  collaboration.  So  far  Jabber  is  leading  this  charge  due  to  the  integration  and  compatibility  with  our  Cisco  network  and  phone  systems. Jabber, if you already own Cisco phones.  We  use  Jabber  for  all  of  our  internal  employees,  across  all  departments.  It  helps  cut  down  on  needless  email  and  allows  calls  to  be  initiated  and  received  easier.  We  also  use  it  for  quick  and  easy  screen  sharing. Stay Connected No Matter Where You Work.  Jabber  is  available  for  all  domestic  offices.  It  is  optional  software,  but  some  departments  use  it  as  part  of  their  standard  operating  procedures,  and  other  departments  do  not  use  it  at  all.  Some  individuals  use  it  for  their  specific  needs  (e.g.  using  the  computer  to  take  calls  when  working  off  site.)Jabber  allows  our  employees  to  work  outside  of  the  office  much  more  seamlessly.  They  can  stay  connected  and  available  through  the  flexible  phone  options.  The  integration  with  our  phone  system,  and  Outlook  calendaring,  showing  a \"user s\",  status  (e.g.  On  a  call,  In  a  Meeting),  avoids  unnecessary  interruptions.  The  chat  feature  frees  up  our  Outlook  Inbox  from  non-work  related  communications  (e.g.  \"Are  you  free  for  lunch?\"). Cisco Routers Review.  I  have  implemented  Cisco  Routers  for  most  of  WAN  connections  and  Internet  peering  sites.  Most  of  the  business  issues  like  security  and  bandwidth  issues  are  very  well  handled  by  Cisco  Routers.  The  problems  these  routers  solved  were  VPN  and  WAN  QOS.  Most  of  our  customers  use  these  routers  for  the  whole  organisations  and  across  all  BU. Cisco Routers are still some of the best.  Cisco  Routers  are  used  corporate-wide,  by  700+  users  daily,  including  users  on  campus  and  remotely  via  VPN.  They  address  basic  user  connectivity  to  corporate  assets.  We  do  not  use  many  ACLs  on  these  particular  devices,  opting  for  a  dedicated  firewall  instead,  but  for  routing,  these  devices  are  spot  on.  Meraki,  at  least,  is  much  easier  to  set  up  if  not  as  granular  that  traditional  IOS,  but  for  out  of  the  box  setup, \"can t\",  be  beaten. Best in class routers - a great investment!.  Cisco  Routers  are  utilized  by  our  organization  in  order  to  host  our  film  database  and  manage  our  library  of  prior  film  submissions.  We  are  looking  for  the  most  cost  effective  solution  to  manage  our  database  of  over  250,000  films  while  reducing  the  latency  viewers  experience  while  accessing  prior  films  and  submitting  new  films  to  our  database. New Gen Cisco Routers are still great !.  We  are  a  full  time  Cisco  Shop,  and  use  Cisco  Routers  for  multiple  reasons  and  at  multiple  locations.  Also  when  vendors  install  equipment  in  our  locations  our  preference  is  to  use  Cisco  equipment  for/by  them  in  order  to  maintain  stability.  Cisco  has  proven  to  be  the  de  facto  standard  in  routing  and  in  support  models!  The  new  generation  of  routers  provide  stability  and  full  time  availability  to  our  organization  as  a  whole. The de-facto network equipment standard delivers quality routers.  All  our  routers  are  Cisco  routers  and  have  been  for  many  years.  Cisco  is  still  the  de  facto  standard  and  have  very  high  quality.  From  a  technical  perspective  the  internet  is  a  very  good  resource  for  any  troubleshooting  you  might  need  to  do:  there  is  a  massive  amount  of  documentation  and  experience  to  be  found  on  the  web  regarding  Cisco. Cisco RV is a good small business router option.  I  recently  used  two  RV  models  of  Cisco  Routers,  more  precisely  the  RV042  and  RV340.  The  main  feature  used  is  the  VPN  and  in  both  it  worked  well.  I  believe  most  of  those  looking  for  and  purchasing  this  line  of  Cisco  Routers  are  looking  to  implement  such  functionality  in  their  small  and  medium  businesses. Buy for brand recognition, look around for performance and stability.  They  are  used  in  our  distribution,  core,  and  peering  layers. Cisco ASA - Well suited to a Cisco-heavy environment.  We  use  a  pair  of  Cisco  ASAs  in  an  active/standy  pair  as  our  internal  firewalls.  To  segment  traffic  between  VLANs.  It  is  used  across  the  entire  organisation.  The  main  concern  it  addresses  is  of  course  security  and  only  allowing  users  to  get  to  resources  that  they  are  allowed  to  go  to  and  have  a  reason  for  going  to. Cisco ASA In a Nutshell.  Cisco  ASA  was  used  at  the  organization  I  was  employed  in.  Also,  I  deployed  it  to  several  companies  as  a  VAR.  Cisco  ASA  was  deployed  as  a  standalone  product,  as  well  as  in  an  HA  environment  for  reliability.  Cisco  ASA  was  used  as  an  edge  firewall  for  organizations  in  all  environments;  it  was  deployed. YES to ASA for your business.  Our  Cisco \"ASA s\",  act  as  our  perimeter  gateways  for  our  corporate  offices.  We  also  have  our  two  largest  sites  outside  of  our  headquarters  using  the  devices  to  connect  via  a  VPN.  This  allows  for  access  to  corporate  information  housed  on  storage  area  networks  based  in  the  corporate  data  centers A next generation firewall of high performance and quality..  Cisco  ASA  is  a  next  generation  firewall  that  I  have  used  and  managed  for  almost  2  years.  It  is  robust  equipment  that  is  positioned  on  the  edge  to  protect  from  virtual  attack,  and  it  also  makes  web  content  filtering  to  block  access  to  undue  pages  from  certain  sectors  in  the  company.  Two  units  were  purchased  at  each  branch. Cisco ASA FW in front of SDN.  We  are  using  a  Cisco  ASA  firewall  in  front  of  our  SDN  data  centre  network  to  form  first  line  protection  against  the  Internet.  We  automate  all  our  configurations  to  this  platform  with  other  Cisco  tools  and  ASA  fits  fine  to  this  zero  touch  day  2  operation  model. ASA is a good product, but there are better options for less money.  ASA  was  being  used  as  our  perimeter  firewall  before  being  replaced  by  an  NGFW.  All  traffic  and  client  VPNs  terminated  at  this  device.  It  has  addressed  the  most  basic  needs  of  firewalling  and  routing  but  does  not  address  next-generation  features. Industry Standard and for Good Reasons.  Our  Cisco \"ASA s\",  are  the  firewalls  for  our  entire  enterprise,  so  in  a  sense, \"they re\",  used  by  the  whole  organization.  However,  only  IT  manages  and  monitors  them,  so  it  would  also  be  fair  to  say \"it s\",  used  by  one  department  in  that  sense.  All  businesses,  no  matter  the  size,  need  to  have  a  firewall.  Cyber  attacks  are  a  significant  problem  in  the  world,  and  a  safe,  secure,  up-to-date  firewall  is  a  critical  piece  of  securing  a \"business s\",  data. One of the best firewalls in the industry.  We  have  multiple  clustered  and  nonclustered  ASA  appliances  with  various  models  and  configurations.  It  mostly  used  on  the  edge  and  for  other  internal  purposes  such  as  a  transparent  firewall.  We  also  use  firepower  in  this  new  -X  ASAs  as  our  primary  IPS  on  the  internet  edge.  This  allows  us  to  not  have  extra  devices  in  line  before  or  after  the  firewalls. Cisco ASA to Protect Your Networks.  We  use  Cisco  ASA  across  our  whole  enterprise  network.  We  use  them  to  protect  our  local  LANs  to  support  PCI  compliance  and  to  protect  any  internet-facing  circuits. Cisco ASA Review.  Cisco  ASA  is  used  internally  by  our \"organization s\",  IT  department  to  secure  the  perimeter  edge.  We  also  use  Cisco  ASA  in  our  lab  to  do  testings  of  multiple  client  scenarios.  We  sell  Cisco  ASA  to  customers  and  implement  Cisco  ASA  as  well  for  customers  in  a  project  environment.  It  addresses  network  security  issues  on  the  perimeter  and  sometimes  even  in  the  data  centre,  however,  Cisco  Firepower  appliances  are  more  well-suited  to  this  implementation. Cisco ASA review.  Cisco  ASA  is  being  used  in  a  department  addressing  the  protection  of  several  critical  aspects.  It  is  being  used  along  with  firepower  in  order  to  streamline  the  level  of  security  needed. Cisco ASA Review.  We  use  the  ASA  as  a  firewall,  intrusion  prevention,  and  VPN  in  the  whole  organization.  Basically \"it s\",  a  proactive  threat  defense  that  stops  attacks  before  they  spread  through  the  network. The ASA will do almost anything you ask of it, if you know how to ask.  We  use  our  Cisco  ASA  as  a  traditional  firewall,  inspecting  and  routing  traffic.  We  also  have  Firepower  running  on  it,  which  allows  us  to  use  it  for  content  filtering. Decent Firewall at a decent price point.. \"We ve\",  deployed  ASAs  throughout  our  multiple  datacenters  and  we  also  use  them  as  onsite  edge  devices  at  many  of  our  client  sites. \"We re\",  using  them  for  NATing  client  devices  as  well  as  applying  stringent  ACLs  to  control  what  clients  can  access  on  our  networks  and  what  we  can  access  on  a  clients  network. Cisco ASA Inside The Datacenter.  Cisco  ASA  is  used  to  filter  access  to  very  specific  networks  that  need  isolation  from  the  rest  of  the  information  system.  Our  requirements  were  to  have  a  good  level  of  security,  along  with  enough  flexibility  so  that  we  could  address  unpredictable  changes  in  the  feature  set  that  the  admins  of  those  networks  may  demand  in  the  future. Cisco ASA - Solid contender, but don\\'t use the ips!.  The  Cisco  ASA  platform  has  become  the  standard  which  I  use  for  most  of  my  SOHO  and  enterprise  setups.  I  most  recently  have  used  this  as  a  buffer  between  an  AWS  environment  and  a  production  network,  where  it  behaved  flawlessly.  A  second  use  case  was  as  a  VPN  concentrator  to  consolidate  all  client  to  site,  and  site  to  site  VPN  connectivity,  where  it  again  behaved  admirably. Robustness and quality above all!!.  We  use  it  in  several  critical  access  and  control  points,  both  internal  and  external.  With  it  we  deploy  the  VPNs  that  interlace  all  our  offices  and  authorized  consultants  for  remote  access.Together  with  other  tools  of  the  same  brand,  automated  rules  are  established  that  allow  a  more  effective  control  of  cybersecurity  inside  and  outside  the  company. ASA, really means Awesome Security Appliance!!!.  We  use  Cisco  ASA  units  for  internal  remote  users  to  remain  connected  to  our  network  for  access  to  applications,  file  shares  and  corporate  email.  We  also  recommend  and  sell  ASA  units  to  customers  for  use  in  their  networks.  Lastly,  we  recommend  and  sell  ASA  units  to  customers  that  we  host  for  various  applications,  so  that  they  can  have  access  to  \"cloud\"  based  apps  but  also  be  as  secure  as  possible  in  the  access  thereof. Cisco ASA met all our network firewall needs..  Cisco  ASA  is  our  main  firewall  for  our  site.  It  is  also  the  VPN  termination  point  for  our  LAN  to  LAN  VPNs  and  Remote  Access  VPNs.  It  has  solved  the  problem  of  needing  a  firewall  for  cyber  security.  It  has  also  solved  the  problem  of  employees  needing  remote  access  into  the  corporate  network. Good classic firewall, but not a next gen winner..  We  deploy  the  CIsco  ASA  5505  &  5506  on  over  250 \"customers \",  sites  to  protect  the  local  LAN  and  establish  a  site-to-site  VPN  to  our  datacenter  from  which  we  host  the  customer  applications.  On  our  datacenter,  we  use  an  HA  pair  of  ASA  5585s  to  produce  redundant  internet  access  and  NAT  all  traffic. Our experiences with Cisco ASA firewalls..  We  have  about  a  dozen  Cisco  ASA  models  deployed  from  5505-5545.  We  use  them  to  separate  traffic  between  internal  organizations,  for  DMZ,  and  for  VPN  (both  IPSEC  and  SSL).  The  problems  these  units  address  are  two-fold:  to  protect  our  internal  network  from  foreign  networks  that  we  have  no  control  over,  and  to  protect  the  foreign  networks  from  the  chance  of  getting  infected  by  something  on  our  internal  network. The Swiss Army Knife of Firewalls.  Cisco  ASA  provides  many  security  and  networking  features.  These  include  VPN  (Virtual  Private  Network)  capabilities,  traffic  prioritization,  DHCP,  Firewall  protection  of  our  network,  routing,  and  many  more.  These  allow  our  business  to  operate  securely,  give  remote  employees  easy  access  to  our  on-network  services,  shape  our  traffic  to  allow  critical  services  (such  as  VOIP)  to  operate  at  higher  priority,  and  generally  give  us  fine-tuned  control  over  the  operation  and  management  of  our  network  and  how  it  interacts  with  the  outside  world. Cisco ASA Rocks!.  We  use  Cisco  ASA  at  the  headquarters  and  the  sites  to  build  our  cross-network  and  edge  gateway.  Like  always,  Cisco  rocks  with  their  hardware,  no  issues  at  all.  Even  better  now  with  the  Cloud  services,  Cisco  pushes  down  updates  to  the  ASA  blocking  potential  threads. Cisco ASA - Aging tech no longer a leader in the firewall market.  The  Cisco  ASA  platform  has  a  niche  place  in  our  infrastructure.  It  is  a  decent  stateful  firewall  but  lacks  features  and  functionality  for  changes  in  network  security,  segmentation,  and  user-based  access  controls.  It  is  a  good  SSL  VPN  technology  but  that  is  about  the  only  feature  on  the  ASA  platform  that  is  widely  used.  As  technology  advances,  it  appears  that  Cisco  has  forgotten  about  the  ASA. Cisco ASA using VPN phones.  We  use  Cisco  ASA  for  our  remote  phone  VPN  users.  It’s  being  used  primarily  by  our  attorneys  that  sometimes  work  at  home.  It  allows  our  users  to  have  a  home  office  and  work  with  our  clients  and  have  them  accessible  for  conferences  and  gives  our  users  flexibility  to  conduct  business  outside  the  office. CISCO ASA: A SCALABLE & FUTURISTIC SCALABALE SECURE SOLUTION.  Cisco  ASA  is  our  main  Perimeter  firewall  across  the  globe,  routing  all  the  internet  traffic  in  and  out  of  our  infrastructure.  It  gives  the  secured  way  of  filtering  traffic  as  per  our  need.  The  best  part  of  ASA  is  the  support  and  trust  of  loyalty  in  last  10  years  we  just  never  have  to  reboot  the  device  once  also.  Its  credibility  is  amazing. Cisco ASA for Small to Medium Businesses.  This  device  is  being  used  across  the  entire  organization.  It  is  currently  our  firewall  and  what  guards  us  from  exterior  attacks.  It  is  also  functioning  as  our  VPN  provider  for  users  that  need  access  outside  of  the  company. Great solution heading in right direction..  Cisco  ASA  is  used  as  a  border  firewall  at  the  network  edge  and  also  between  critical  network  segments  and  other  parts  of  the  network.  With  Cisco  ASA  we  achieved  remote  access  connectivity  and  event  logging.  Next-gen  features  are  used  at  network  edge  with  regard  to  performance.  By  using  Cisco  ASA  awe  created  reliable  network  edge  gateways  with  minimal  Open. Gold Standard in Enterprise Security.  My  organization  switched  to  the  ASA  from  the  PIX  close  to  8  years  ago.  We  were  looking  for  a  solution  that  provided  added  security,  better  redundancy,  integrated  well  with  our  existing  Cisco  infrastructure  and  was  easy  to  manage  and  use.  The  ASA  addressed  all  of  those  concerns  and  has  been  a  critical  component  in  our  network  stacks  since. The Gold Standard in Enterprise Firewalls.  Cisco  ASA  is  the  industry  standard  for  firewall  software.  I  am  not  an  expert  on  ASA  by  any  means,  but  I  have  used  several  of  the  basic  functions  such  as  SSL  VPN  and  configuring  different  VLANs  for  multiple  devices.  I  only  use  the  Command  Line  Interface,  and  never  the  ASDM  which  runs  on  a  Java  applet. From Small Business to Enterprise Level the Cisco ASA is a great Firewall for any Business.  We  use  the  Cisco  ASA  as  our  public  ingress  and  egress  entry  points  across  our  organization.  We  have  been  using  Cisco  ASA  for  many  years  securing  our  users  when  accessing  the  internet  and  securing  our  network  from  users  on  the  internet  accessing  websites  we  host.  We  also  use  Cisco  ASA  for  VPN  access.  We  have  multiple  site  to  site  VPNs  along  with  Cisco  Any  Connect  VPN  for  users  accessing  corporate  resources  when  out  of  the  office.

One  is  as  a  VPN  concentrator  and  remote  access  VPN.  Secondly  as  an  access  control  firewall  for  business  to  business  partnerships.  Lastly  as  an  internal  network  segmentation  security  device.  Cisco  ASA  is  well  suited  for  two  of  these  functions  and  not  as  granular  as \"we d\",  like  in  the  third.  The  VPN  service  is  bullet  proof  and  highly  reliable.  Overall  the  Cisco  ASA  platform  is  extremely  reliable  in  terms  of  uptime  and  high  availability. Why I recommend Cisco / Meraki.

Enterprise  grade  protection  and  monitoring  for  external  connections.  Complex  and  feature  packed,  but  as  long  as  you  can  afford  to  employ  Cisco  professionals  then  this  is  a  great  choice  for  your  network  protection.Scaleable,  and  with  the  usual  Cisco  quality,  the  feature  set  is  impressive.  Best  used  in  a  Cisco  environment,  it  is  overkill  and  expensive  in  a  non  Cisco  environment.  Difficult  to  argue  that  other  loading  firewalls  do  not  offer  at  least  as  much  for  a  much  reduced  price,  but  if  you  are  a  Cisco  env,  then  your  techs  will  not  thank  you  for  choosing  a  non  Cisco  firewall  with  the  associated  learning  curve. Cisco ASA is the way to go.  We  use  the  ASA  as  a  firewall,  intrusion  prevention  and  VPN.  This  is  used  for  the  whole  organization.  Basically  a  proactive  threat  defense  that  tops  attacks  before  they  spread  through  the  network. Great for a Cisco Admin to use on the external layer..

We  use  it  to  collaborate  and  share  information  to  help  each  other  to  troubleshoot  and  discuss  end-user  issues  with  equipment  and  services  we  support.  We  have  increased  the  scope  of  this  to  also  communicate  with  some  of  our  external  suppliers  to  easily  request  and  receive  quotations  for  work  or  equipment.  This  allows  us  to  be  much  more  responsive  and  get  information  back  and  forth  between  people  or  companies  very  quickly  and  easily,  from  any  device  we  may  be  carrying  at  the  time  (Phone,  Laptop,  Tablet,  etc).

Cisco  Spark  is  currently  available  to  all  employees  across  the  whole  organization.  Although  it  is  not  used  by  every  group  it  serves  to  connect  the  entire  company  through  instant  messaging.  It  is  also  connected  with  Outlook  and  other  products  so  that  it  is  easy  to  connect  with  other  individuals.  Sometimes,  you  just  need  a  quick  way  to  connect  with  someone  in  a  less  formal  way  than  an  e-mail.  Cisco  Spark  is  a  solution  to  that  need. Wireless for everyone!.  Cisco  Access  Point You can rely on Cisco WiFi.  Cisco  Access  Point  Cisco  2800  Series Cisco Unified Communications Manager Review.  We  use  Cisco  Unified  Communications  Manager  servers  to  control  all  our  telephony  devices  like  i  Phones,  telepresence  rooms,  desktop  video  devices,  analog  phones,  etc.  We  use  it  in  our  company  and  in  new  implementations  with  our  customers.  This  specific  server  in  the  Cisco  Collaboration  portfolio  is  the  one  that  controls  all  the  calls  and  call  routing,  and  it  has  a  lot  of  custom  features  to  make  IP  telephony  more  robust.  The  business  problems  that  it  solves  are  the  lack  of  communication  with  all  your  partners,  keeping  them  all  together. CUCM is your choice if you want everything plus the kitchen sink, you want it on-prem and you have the $$.  We  use  CUCM  on-premise  as  our  voice  over  IP  (Vo  IP)  solution,  sometimes  others  will  refer  to  it  as  a  \"PBX\"  or  \"voice  services\"  software.  CUCM  is  one  of  several  components  that  work  together  to  provide  telephony  across  the  entire  enterprise.  CUCM  ties  into  and  controls,  at  least  in  part,  all  of  the  other  communications  components  that  we  use,  such  as  our  voicemail,  emergency  call  handling,  audio  conferencing,  teleconferencing  and  video  calling,  paging  systems  and  PBX  operator,  which  of  which  work  together  with  CUCM  being  the  \"conductor\".  It  enables  us  to  make  phone  calls  to  each  other  and  the  rest  of  the  world,  just  like  an  analog  phone,  except  that  voip  calls  can  include  extra  stuff  other  than  sound,  such  as  video.

It  provides,  phone,  video,  voicemail,  automated  attendant,  toll  bypass,  desktop  chat,  and  mobile  chat. Most powerful VOIP solution.  Cisco  Unified  Communication  Manager  (  Call  Manager  )  is  being  used  across  our  whole  organization  to  handle  the  collaboration  between  employees  and  each  other.  We  used  it  as  a  call  manager  for  our  Cisco  i  Phones  and  using  it  for  instant  messaging,  presence,  and  Jabber  communication.  Also, \"it s\",  responsible  for  communication  between  our  branches. Cost-effective Solution.  Cisco  Unified  Communications  is  being  used  across  the  whole  organization.  It  allows  any  employee  to  easily  communicate  to  peers  fast,  cheap  and  with  high  quality.  It  is  very  simple  to  connect  and  interact  with  each \"office s\",  local  infrastructure.  The  migration  process  has  been  very  simple,  without  having  any  outstanding  items  during  implementation.  It  took  me  an  average  of  2.5  hours  to  migrate  50-100 \"users \",  offices. Cisco Unified Communications Manager Review.  I  used  CUCM  until  some  months  ago  in  a  strategic  consultancy  firm  and  with  many  customers  within  Chile,  Argentina,  and  Bolivia.  I  was  being  used  by  all  external  consultants  and  the  operative  teams  within  the  customers.  There  were  very  few  business  problems  and  we  were  very  happy  with  this  solution.  We  faced  some  delays  and  latency  in  some  calls  but  the  issues  were  always  related  to  connectivity  or  network.  It  is  not  a  \"cheap\"  solution  and  the  quality  of  the  product  was  more  than  satisfactory.  If  the  meeting  has  more  than  199  attendees  you  will  not  be  able  to  attend  the  call. Cisco Call Manager.  Call  Manager  is  being  used  by  all  of  the  employees  of  the  college.  We  have  just  over  500  handsets  on  campus.  We  have  about  100  active  users  of  Jabber.  Facilities  will  use  Jabber  on  their  smartphones,  where  they  do  not  have  cell  coverage,  but  they  can  get  a  wifi  signal  to  make  support  calls. Cisco Unified Communications Manager - VoIP Phone Solution on Steroids.  We  use  Cisco  Unified  Communications  Manager  across  our  entire  organization.

This  allows  for  easy  four  digit  dialing  between  offices  and  provides  organization  wide  voicemail  and  instant  messaging  and  presents.  The  system  also  allows  us  to  receive  calls  originating  from  location  and  answer  from  another  to  provide  better  coverage  between  departments  and  regions. Another great communication tool from Cisco!.  Cisco  Unified  Communications  Manager  is  being  used  at  my  organization  for  communicating  within  our  organization  as  well  as  with  others  that  are  external  to  our  organization,  including  vendors,  third  parties,  or  clients.  The  Call  Manager  software  is  being  used  across  the  whole  organization.  The  business  problem  it  addresses  is  that  it  allows  seamless  communication  within  and  outside  our  organization  on  a  day  to  day  basis. Cisco IP Phone.  Cisco  is  used  throughout  the  entire  organization.  I  believe  it  was  about  5  years  (maybe  more)  when  they  changed  to  Cisco  and  we  got  new  phones. \"It s\",  nice  to  be  able  to  log  into  your  voicemail  (or  even  your  extension)  from  a  different  phone  if  you  need  to  move.  I  also  like  how \"it s\",  connected  to  Jabber  so  I  can  get  to  my  voicemail  or  make  calls  from  my  computer  if \"I m\",  away  from  a  phone  set. \"It s\",  pretty  easy  to  use,  has  a  nice  display.  For  our  adjunct  faculty,  it  is  nice  that  they  can  log  into  the  phone  and  then  log  off  when  they  are  gone,  since  they  use  shared  space  and  share  phones  with  one  another. Cisco IP Phone System.  Cisco  Unified  Communications  Manager  is  easy  to  use,  and  the  phone  also  connects  with  my  computer.  When  I  am  listening  to  music  on  my  computer  when  the  phone  rings,  my  music  is  automatically  muted.  Also,  I  like  the  message  system.  Not  only  will  you  have  the  messages  on  your  phone,  but  you  will  also  get  them  in  an  email.  Display  is  also  updated  to  have  your  personal  information  and  can  be  customized  to  ring  through  the  computer  and  with  different  ring  tones.  I  like  this  system,  great  for  any  size  business. Cisco Call Manager can do anything you need it to do (and plenty you don\\'t need it to do too)..  We  use  Cisco  Unified  Communications  Manager  (Call  Manager)  across  our  whole  agency  to  manage  all  of  our  Vo  IP  phones,  users  and  gateways.  We  also  use  it  to  integrate  with  our  paging  systems  and  attendant  console  solution.  It  has  enabled  us  to  centrally  manage  all  of  this,  which  was  previously  managed  individually  at  every  location,  and  to  allow  phone  number  mobility  between  locations  and  also  with \"users \",  mobile  devices. Call manager that fits the need.  Cisco  Unified  Communications  Manager  (Call  Manager)  is  the  heart  of  our  telecommunications  for  our  organization.  We  use  Call  Manager  for  our  voice,  messaging  and  contact  centers.  Across  all  departments,  nearly  every  staff  has  a  phone  assigned.  We  use  Call  Manager  as  our  primary  platform  for  making  and  receiving  calls.  We  also  use  Finesse  as  the  software  choice  for  our  contact  center. Cisco Unified Communications Manager Handles all the Calls.  We  are  using  the  tool  across  our  entire  organization.  We  have  all  our  branches  setup  with  5  digits  dialing  from  every  desk  set.  It  takes  care  of  branch  to  branch  voice  calling.  Also,  we  have  all  of  our  phone  lines  connected  to  the  system  so  that  we  can  manage  call  flow. The most comprehensive IP communication solution on the market.  Cisco  Unified  Communications  Manager  is  possibly  the  most  widely  used  IT  infrastructure  solution  across  our  company  by  far.  We  started  deploying  it  modestly,  in  2004,  for  a  small  portion  of  our  users  in  one  department,  and  for  some  IT  users.  Since  then,  we  started  to  increase  the  adoption,  mostly  when  we  had  new  departments  or  office  layout  changes,  where  it  was  easier  and  cheaper  to  deploy.  At  some  port,  we  also  started  to  deploy  it  in  remote  sites,  across  the  globe.  That  movement  allowed  us  to  have  a  seamless  phone  experience  and  allowed  our  users  to  communicate  across  the  globe.  The  US  office  could  easily  call  HQ  in  Brazil  without  any  cost  per  minute.  That  was  a  game-changer  and  allowed  us  to  promote  more  with  fast  communication  between  offices.  At  some  point,  we  decided  to  replace  all  the  old  TDM  PBXs  and  that  bunch  of  cables  for  the  small  and  simple  UCS  servers.  Besides  the  fact  that  it  saved  a  lot  of  real  estate  in  our  datacenter  also  saved  us  time  by  letting  us  administer  on  a  single  console.  Those  were  some  of  the  business  problems  we  solved  during  these  past  15  years  with  Cisco. Efficiency Achieved.  We  utilize  CUCM  across  all  of  our  corporate  contact  centers,  it  allows  us  to  centrally  manage  our  end-points  and  helps  us  take  care  of  the  MACD  support  for  thousands  of  users  with  just  one  small  telecom  team. A great system.  It  is  used  to  solve  the  problem  of  seeing  if  a  customer  was  hung  up  on,  if  our  reps  are  taking  calls  and  how  many  calls  they  have  taken.  It  is  used  by  our  whole  organization  but  mostly  by  our  tech  department.  We  use  it  also  to  see  how  many  calls  were  taken  in  a  day,  week  or  month. Managing Unified Communications everywhere made simple.  We  chose,  designed  and  deployed  a  Cicso  UCM  based  solution,  globally,  to  provide  us  our  collaboration  backbone  and  make  staying  in  touch  real-time  real.  Spanning  4  continents  and  multiple  timezones  can  sometimes  make  conferencing  tricky,  but  with  Webex  and  Cisco  MRA  this  is  easily  overcome  and  allows  us  to  stay  in  touch  no  matter  where  we  are. Call Manager Use in the Enterprise.  We  use  Call  Manager  to  provide  our  enterprise  with  voice  connectivity.  It  allows  us  to  centrally  administer  over  180  offices  and  close  500  remote  workers. Cisco Unified Communications Manager Makes Our Phone Calls Braindead Simple.

Our  organization  is  using  CUCM  primarily  for  PBX  functionality  but  also  incorporating  the  end  user  management  for  Cisco  Jabber  and  some  auto  attendant  functionality  in  conjunction  with  UCCX.  We  are  late  in  the  process  of  transitioning  from  Avaya  to  Cisco  and  a  separate  contact  center  platform.  We  are  adopting  CUCM  throughout  our  entire  organization,  even  working  to  replace  remote  key  systems  with  the  primary  goal  of  having  centralized  support,  less  reliance  on  expensive  small  vendors  and  having  a  homogenized  environment,  simplifying  support. Review of Callmanager in a global setup. \"I m\",  using  the  Call  Manager  as  central  call  control  solution  for  our  global  voice  and  video  endpoints  including  our  Jabber  clients. \"It s\",  the  central  call  control  solution  for  all  locations  worldwide  and  helps  us  to  provide  a  harmonized  IT  workplace  for  all  users.  Besides  the  standardization  of  the  workplace,  it  helps  to  improve  service  processes  through  centralized  management  of  the  solution. CUCM isn\\'t just for Call Routing! Route your faxes and even manage PA Systems!.  Cisco  Unified  Communications  Manager  (CUCM)  Call  Manager  is  used  to  manage  all  our  phone  numbers  throughout  our  organization.  Additionally,  it  is  used  to  route  a  portion  of  fax  numbers  to  our  e  Fax  server  (Stone  Fax)  as  well  as  a  recent  implementation  of  Informacast  which  is  used  as  our  PA  system  at  our  school  sites.  It  routes  all  our  calls,  digital  and  analog  throughout  our  whole  school  district. Cisco Call Manager, a robust phone system.  We  use  Cisco  Unified  Communications  Manager  for  our  Phone  system.  We  have  an  on-premise  phone  system.  We  have  2  nodes.  A  Pub  and  a  Sub  so  if  a  link  goes  out  our  off-site  Sub  takes  over  and  our  phone  system  still  works.  We  also  use  Cisco  Unity  for  our  voice  mail. Cisco UCM.  Cisco  UCM  is  our  main  phone  system,  we  have  integration  with  AD  and  have  just  started  using/testing  Jabber  with  mobile  phones  for  our  IT  department.  It  has  been  working  great  allowing  me  to  answer  my  desk  phone  from  anywhere.  Management  of  users  is  simple  and  efficient. Review of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM).  We  use  CUCM  to  manage  our  Cisco  phone  environment  of  roughly  1200  phones.  This  includes  roughly  100  emergency  phones  of  various  types.  We  integrate  directly  with  Exchange  2016  for  Unified  Communication,  which  allows  voicemail  to  go  directly  to  the \"user s\",  inbox.  (We  do  not  use  Unity.)  We  have  around  half  dozen  IP  phone  models  (7941/42,  6921,  etc.). Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM).

My  company  uses  this  product  to  deploy  IP  phones  and  analog  telephony  products  to  multiple  sites  across  the  state.  CUCM  is  very  stable  and  handles  our  20k+  phone  deployment  very  well.  I  would  recommend  some  basic  training  before  deploying  or  administrating  this  solution.  It  can  be  quite  difficult  to  spin  up  for  the  new  user.  We  use  Communications  Manager  with  Unity  Connection  and  Contact  Center  Express  for  a  complete  voice  solution.

Cisco Unified Communications Manager, all your communication needs in one package.. \"I ve\",  worked  very  closely  with  Cisco  Unified  Communications  Manager  thanks  to  a  number  of  our  clients.  They  use  it  for  everything  from  something  as  basic  to  a  phone  call,  to  video  conferences,  and  even  down  to  basic  instant  messaging  inside  the  corporation.  From  a  management  perspective, \"it s\",  intuitive  to  administer,  easy  to  get  set  up,  and  very  robust  for  my \"client s\",  communication  needs.  Overall  I  consider  this  a  great  product. Powerful Phone System.  Cisco  Unified  Communications  Manager  was  used  by  one  remote  manufacturing  plant.  Other  sites  used  a  company  standard  system  that  was  decided  upon  and  implemented  after  the  Cisco  system  was  already  in  place.  The  Cisco  Communications  Manager  was  used  to  administrate  the  Cisco  phone  system  that  we  had  in  place  and  could  be  used  to  assign  extensions,  hunt  groups  and  other  phone  features. Cisco DNA Center.  We  have  upgraded  our  Cisco  3850  switches  with  the  new  Cisco  catalyst  9K  series  switches.  We  bought  DNA  Center  for  assurance,  to  begin  with.  Maybe  later  down  the  road,  we  will  incorporate  more  automation  and  all  the  other  features  that  DNA  Center  can  offer.  Assurance  is  a  good  tool  to  use  to  check  the  status  of  your \"9K s\",  as  well  as  help  with  troubleshooting  issues  if  they  come  up. Cisco DNA Center Review.  We  are  adapting  to  the  new  solution.  We  currently  have  half  of  our  parent  building  with  DNA  (areas  such  as  HR,  Development,  Marketing  are  already  using  it).  We  had  an  extra  effort  to  have  to  fine-tune  the  permissions  by  areas,  which  takes  time  and  dedication  to  adjust  them  in  the \"institution s\",  firewalls. Cisco DNA Center Review.  We  reseller  DNA  to  a  Financial  Business.  They  use  to  campus  network.  They  have  micro  and  macro  segmentation  in  wired  and  wireless  networks. Partially happy with Cisco\\'s DNA solution, it\\'s missing polish, but it\\'s a good start.  DNA  center  es  parte  de  una  solución  de  SD  access  para  una  entidad  Estatal,  no  existen  problemas  en  la  parte  comercial  pero  en  realidad  existen  inconvenientes  con  la  parte  de  licencias  de  los  otros  componentes  de  la  solución  DNA  center  is  part  of  an  SD  access  solution  for  a  state  entity,  there  are  no  problems  on  the  commercial  side  but  in  reality  there  are  inconveniences  with  the  licensing  part  of  the  other  components  of  the  solution DNA Center is an important tool for any service-providing business!.  Currently,  there  are  9K  Series  Catalyst  Switches  which  have  a  premier  license,  but  the  problem  is  that  it  is  very  expensive  in  some  cases  to  have  the  possibility  of  installing  a  DNA  center  for  the  cost  of  the  physical  equipment.It  is  important  that  the  center  has  different  size  options  since  this  will  help,  depending  on  the  size  of  the  company  that  has  a  network  implemented  with  it,  to  have  the  ability  to  choose  the  size  of  the  appliance  and  also  lower  costs. The best solution for large-scale infrastructure (La mejor solucion para las infraestructuras de gran tamano).  I  consider  DNA  Center  to  be  one  of  the  best  solutions  Cisco  has  for  infrastructure,  the  value  it  brings  is  substantial.  Every  detail  was  considered  to  provide  the  most  complete  information  that  network  administrators  need.

Cisco  DNA  is  presently  used  in  all  of  our  organization.  It  is  perfect  to  know  how  it  works  our  network  with  Cisco  DNA  Assurance.  Currently,  we \"don t\",  have  the  wireless  product  with  Cisco  DNA,  to  know  the  full  advantages  that  DNA  provides. Cisco DNA Center Review. \"We re\",  about  to  sell  it,  and  we  used  it  for  app/product  demos  and  have  a  showroom.  The  business  problems  it  tries  to  eliminate  are  the  speed  issues  when  trying  to  resolve  any  issue  in  the  network. Experience with our first implementation of Cisco DNA Center.  Actualmente  se  ha  implementado  con  un  cliente  para  optimizar  la  red  lan  en  Ecuador  It  has  currently  been  implemented  with  a  client  to  optimize  their  LAN  network  in  Ecuador.

Actualmente  estoy  consultando  sobre  una  solucion  que  me  permita  integrar  la  administracion  de  los  equipos  de  red  de  mi  empresa,  para  lo  cual  debemos  tener  en  cuenta  que  son  equipos  de  distintas  marcas  pero  con  una  tendencia  a  utilizar  equipos  CISCO  en  el  DATA  CENTER  sin  embargo  actualmente  tengo  multiples  Switch,  APs  y  otros  dispositivos  que  no  son  CISCO.DNA  permite  utilizar  APIs  para  integrar  el  reconocimiento  de  otros  equipos  que  nos  ayuda  a  mejorar  la  administracion  de  nuestra  infraestructura  de  red,  podemos  desplegar  en  pocos  minutos  la  implementacion  de  politicas  de  seguridad,  acceso  y  control  de  trafico,  en  un  entorno  grafico,  facil  de  utilizar  y  con  muchas  ventajas  frente  a  un  obsoleto  sistema  de  configuracion  basado  en  Linea  de  Comandos.  Aun  mas  DNA  Center  nos  ayuda  a  tener  una  mejor  vision  de  nuestra  red,  integrada  para  proporcionar  las  funcionalidades  que  requiere  la  empresa  u  organizacion  y  con  ello  ser  mas  productivos  con  la  tecnologia.  I  am  currently  consulting  on  a  solution  that  allows  me  to  integrate  the  administration  of  my \"company s\",  network  equipment,  for  which  we  must  take  into  account  that  they  are  sometimes  equipment  of  different  brands,  but  with  a  tendency  to  use  CISCO  equipment  in  our  data  center,  however,  I  currently  have  multiple  switches,  APs,  and  other  non-CISCO  devices.DNA  allows  us  to  use  APIs  to  integrate  the  recognition  of  other  equipment  that  helps  us  improve  the  administration  of  our  network  infrastructure,  we  can  deploy  in  a  few  minutes  the  implementation  of  security  policies,  access,  and  traffic  control,  in  a  graphical  environment,  easy  to  use  and  with  many  advantages  over  an  obsolete  configuration  system  based  on  Command  Line.Even  more  DNA  Center  helps  us  to  have  a  better  vision  of  our  network,  integrated  to  provide  the  functionalities  that  the  company  or  organization  requires  and  thus  be  more  productive  with  the  technology. Cisco DNA Center: Network documentation simplified--make your life easier!.  Cisco  DNA  Center  is  being  used  by  external  business  units  in  our  organization  to  improve  their  network  documentation.  One  of  the  main  features  that  makes  Cisco  DNA  Center  powerful  is  the  ability  to  create  a  network  map  and  an  inventory  sheet.  This  allows  the  team  to  save  an  enormous  amount  of  time  in  understanding  the  network  design.  Moreover,  Cisco  DNA  Center  is  compatible  with  i  OS  legacy  devices.  This  means  that  you  can  still  use  Cisco  DNA  Center  if  you  have  old  devices  in  your  network.  After  testing  it  on  smaller  sites,  now \"we re\",  starting  to  rule  it  out  in  bigger  sites. DNA Center - good product, but needs to mature.  It  is  used  to  manage  the  SDA  solution  for  both  our  biggest  campuses.  Our  biggest  drive  to  introduce  it  was  to  do  segmentation  in  our  networks  in  order  to  improve  the  security  for  our  users  and  developers. Cisco DNA Review.  We  faced  a  challenge  with  guest  and  Io  T  access  while  maintaining  PCI  compliance.  With  DNA  Center  in  conjunction  with  LSE,  we  were  able  to  micro-segment  these  resources  away  from  user  traffic.  This  allowed  us  to  securely  deploy  IP  cameras  and  user  tablets  with  much  fewer  hands-on  steps  to  ensure  only  the  proper  equipment  is  allowed  into  the  network. DNA Center is powerful!.  We  use  DNA  Center  to  deploy  the  SD-Access  solution  in  a  lab  environment,  and  we  will  soon  do  so  for  a  client  as  well.  Undoubtedly  the  solution  has  incredible  value.  It  is  fast  and  flexible  for  meeting  a \"customer s\",  needs,  and  makes  troubleshooting  an  unprecedented  simple  experience. Cisco DNA Center Review from an end-user/tester perspective.  My  department  uses  it  for  evaluation  and  possible  mass-deployment  at  the  moment. Review of Cisco DNA Center.  It  is  being  used  at  the  central  office  and  we  are  still  implementing  DNA  assurance. New to Cisco DNA Center.  Se  desea  implementar  esta  solución  para  controlar  el  acceso  a  los  recursos  desde  los  diferentes  departamentos  del  banco.  Se  desea  llevar  integrado  a  ISE.You  want  to  implement  this  solution  to  control  access  to  resources  from  different  departments  of  the  bank.  You  want  to  bring  in  integration  to  ISE. Give Cisco DNA Center a try.  It  is  being  used  across  the  whole  organization.  We  are  currently  testing  it  and  checking  out  all  its  features.  Seems  pretty  good  and  intuitive. Quick review of Cisco DNAC.  We  have  a  first  generation  appliance  and  have  it  in  our  lab/staging  environment.  Currently,  we  are  using  the  1.2.10  version  of  the  DNA  Center  software.  I  would  say  that  the  initial  installation  was  difficult  with  issues  getting  the  10GE  Enterprise  Port  connected  to  a  DC  Catalyst  3850  Switch.  We  tried  Trunk  and  Access  mode  and  two  different  Cisco  switches  and  could  not  get  that  port  up  and  running.  We  finally  got  the  appliance  setup  via  1GE  port  but  being  a  lab  that  was  fine.  We  will  most  likely  re-image  the  box  when  1.3  becomes  available.  On  the  whole  I  like  DNAC  with  features  like  software  image  management  and  Assurance  being  invaluable  to  a  network  engineer.  Once  you  get  Cisco  ISE  integrated  you  can  get  full  analytics  and  telemetry  information  based  on  identity  across  the  network.  SDA  or  Software  Defined  Access  is  a  new  way  or  even  a  paradigm  shift  in  creating  a  campus  LAN.  It  requires  full  Cisco  ISE  integration  utilizing \"SGT s\",  for  user/device  on-boarding.  I  really  like  the  fact  that  a  policy  applies  to  that  user  or  device  no  matter  where  or  how  they  connect  to  the  network.  I  would  say  that  extending  a  fabric  to  other  sites  say  over  a  WAN  is  still  kind  of  a  gray  area  with  little  documentation  or  best  practices  available  yet. Cisco DNA Center Review.  Cisco  DNA  Center  is  invaluable  for  us  to  manage  and  troubleshoot  our  production  and  lab  wireless  networks.  We  are  also  testing  out  SDA  and  are  planning  on  adding  to  our  lab  network  and  possibly  production.  Also,  we  do  utilize  the  SWIM  options  to  help  manage  and  roll  out  IOS  and  IOS-XE  updates.  We  are  now  moving  to  ISE  integration. Cisco DNA Center - First feelings in production.  We  started  with  Cisco  DNA  Center  when  it  was  still  early  on  in  beta  to  test  out  the  features  and  provide  feedback  to  the  product  units.  In  the  early  days  it  was  mostly  used  to  test  the  provisioning  of  SDAs,  but  six  months  ago  we  began  a  production  deployment  to  design,  provision,  manage  and  monitor  the  new  wireless  environment.  The  aim  from  the  beginning  was  to  only  use  Cisco  DNA  Center  to  provision  any  settings  to  the  wireless  environment,  which  has  caused  some  issues  since  not  everything  we  need  is  available  in  Cisco  DNA  Center. Network Engineer Review.  We  use  it  for  a  centralized  point  to  control  the  entire  network. Cisco DNA offers great upside to network management!.  DNA  Center  is  being  deployed  in  our  core  to  help  provide  insight  and  network  assurance  for  our  access  layer  switching  built  on  the  Cisco  Catalyst  9300  switches. Good for big enterprises, but costly for small businesses.  It  helps  to  automate  and  manage  various  network  devices.  In  addition,  it  helps  to  keep  our  network  devices  up  to  date  with  security  patches. Early look is good, but pricing and compartmentalization is ugly.  DNA  Center  is  being  used  primarily  for  assurance  in  one  department.  In  the  future,  we  will  use  the  automation  and  provisioning  and  hopefully  spread  it  to  be  used  in  the  other  departments.  It  is  currently  addressing  the  issue  of  having  historical  data  and  information  when  attempting  to  troubleshoot  endpoints,  but  we  hope  to  use  provisioning  to  automatically  deploy  devices  without  having  to  have  a  trained  on-site  presence  in  the  near  future. DNA Center - When it\\'s good, it\\'s really good... where it\\'s bad, it\\'s really bad.  We,  as  a  Cisco  partner,  install  Cisco  DNA  Center  for  our  customers  as  well  as  in  our  lab.  We  have  been  with  it  since  the  earlier  1.1  on  the  M4  server  (we  got  our  server  after  the  issue  with  the  partitioning  on  the  hard  drives),  and  dealt  with  many  of  the  bugs  throughout  1.2,  and  are  currently  on  1.2.8.  We  have  evaluates  the  auto-provision  and  Pn  P  functionality,  SD-Access  with  fabric  at  a  single  site,  API  and  API  integrations  with  custom  software,  and  Assurance  modules  both  within  DNA  Center  and  integrated  into  ticketing  systems. DNA C.  DNAC  is  useful  for  config  management,  image  deployment  and  mapping  of  our  wireless  environment. May be great product in the future but at the moment it\\'s not in prime time.  It  has  been  used  for  PNP,  templating,  swim,  discovery.  SDA  is  future  use.  It  has  been  used  in  all  of  the  remote  sites.  We  are  still  in  the  early  phase  of  production  deployment. All Cisco?  then DNA Center is for you.  It  is  being  used  by  the  headquarters  and  is  in  the  process  of  being  pushed  out  to  the  branch  offices.  It  is  roughly  80%  deployed.  It  mainly  provides  automation,  speeds  deployment  of  network  services,  and  standardizes  configurations  in  the  Enterprise  Network. Cisco Catalyst 9000 Switching.  [Cisco  Catalyst  Switches  addresses  business  problems  for  our  clients  related  to]  Trends  in  enterprise.Security:  Average  cost  of  a  data  breach  Mobility:  Changing  workforce  and  apps  hyper-connected  Enterprise  Io  T:  Infrastructure,  convergence  &  vulnerable  endpoints  Cloud:  Devices  per  Admin,  agility  consumption  models DNA Center is the future of networking.  We  are  in  the  early  stages  of  a  DNA  Center  and  SD-Access  deployment.  We  are  deploying  it  enterprise  wide  in  order  to  automate  and  secure  our  environment.  The  need  for  standard  configs  that  enhance  our  security  at  the  edge  and  a  single  interface  to  define  and  deploy  policy  across  hundreds  of  devices  really  help  our  efficiency. AppDynamics Review.  We  use  App  Dynamics  to  monitor  many  different \"servers \",  statuses  around  the  globe. Gives Total View of Infrastructure Components and Applications..  We  use  App  Dynamics  for  app  performance  monitoring  of  our  suite  of  applications.  We  also  monitor  critical  business  transactions.  It  is  installed  on  all  of  our  server  devices.  We  can  proactively  monitor  the  apps  to  make  sure  we  are  meeting  our  key  performance  SLAs. A perfect tool that allows me to manage and monitor the performance of all the applications.  The  IT  operations  department  uses  App  Dynamic.  It  provides  synthetic  monitoring  of  our  applications,  allows  us  to  see  in  real  time  how  the  various  applications  installed  by  server  communicate  with  others.  This  helps  us  to  have  control  of  the  connections  and  allows  us  to  have  extract  metrics  of  the  amount  of  possible  errors  between  connections.  It  is  very  valuable  to  monitor  web  services  and  their  connections. AppDynamics Review.  Single  pane  viewing  of  what  matters  most.  The  simple  click  of  a  button  and  I  can  view  infrastructure  response,  user  \"click  thru\"  i.e.  completes  in  a  weekly/monthly  report  that  takes  minutes  instead  of  hours  to  create.  We  were  able  to  view  what  percentage  of  users  visited/clicked  thru  with  the  device  and  time  of  day.  We  were  also  able  to  see  their  drop  point.  Immediately  saw  a  trend  and  got  our  app  team  on  it.  After  that,  we  saw  an  almost  immediate  uptick  with  our  business  partners. Think your application has no issues? Think again and try AppDynamics APM tool!.  Our  application  is  costing  and  contracting  modeling  software.  The  application  involves  very  extensive  calculations  that  are  very  CPU  intensive  on  the  app  server-side  as  well  as  on  the  database  server.  These  calculations  are  pretty  complex  queries  that  needed  optimization  as  they  generally  take  several  hours.  We  brought  in  an  APM  tool  to  look  further  into  these  transactions  to  improve  the  performance.  After  exploring  a  couple  of  products,  we  decided  to  go  with  App  Dynamics.  It  is  currently  used  by  just  our  department. AppDynamics lets you see!!!.  We  have  been  using  it  to  control  some  services  that  we  have  in  the  cloud.  It  has  been  really  helpful,  and  saved  us  from  some  problems. the best investment you can make.  This  product  allows  us  to  have  a  complete  vision  of  the  situation  and  to  be  very  precise  when  solving  for  our  cases. AppDynamics - A deep dive into your application data.  We  use  App  Dynamics  to  gain  insight  into  our  application  through  the  view  of  the  endpoint  which  can  be  a  web  server,  SQL  Database  or  our  storage  systems.  Since  App  Dynamics  relies  on  an  agent  to  process  the  information  it  can  access  the  network,  and  application  stacks,  to  give  us  in-depth  information  about  the  way  traffic  is  being  passed  to/from  each  server  and  allows  us  to  dig  deep  into  errors  that  we  cannot  find  any  other  way. Easy adaptation, easy monitoring at one glance.  Our  application  is  very  data  intensive  and  straight  out  of  the  box,  App  Dynamics  was  able  to  pinpoint  some  pain  points  we \"hadn t\",  noticed.  Certain  queries  required  optimization  as  they  were  being  called  several  million  times,  essentially  doing  a  lot  of  I/O  on  the  DB  server. The Rolls Royce of APM.  App  Dynamics  is  being  used  as  an  application  performance  monitor  spanning  a  multi  tier  cloud  based  environment  which  serivces  up  to  2000+  end  users.  App  Dynamics  is  used  to  identify  bottle  necks  and  performance  issues  within  our  application  as  well  as  provide  real  time  hardware  stats  for  each  of  the  constituent  pieces  of  hardware  within  our  cloud  environment. AppDynamics, it\\'s got you covered..  App  Dynamics  was  introduced  to  help  point  out  any  parts  of  our  products  that  might  not  be  running  as  smoothly  or  as  efficiently  as  possible  to  help  maintain  a  100%  up  time  of  our  products  and  provide  the  best  possible  service  to  our  customers.  App  Dynamics  is  designed  to  be  as  user  friendly  as  possible  for  people  of  any  any  level  of  proficiency  with  technology.  This  allows  for  different  departments  within  the  company  to  utilise  App  Dynamics  for  things  from  analytics  to  monitoring  hardware  to  potential  threats. Performance Sleuth.  App  Dynamics  is  used  by  our  application  developers  to  check  the  performance  of  their  code  before  it  goes  into  production.  They  can  check  if  there  are  any  issues,  and  if  found,  find  out  exactly  in  the  code  where  they  are.  That  targeting  provides  for  very  quick  resolution,  and  thus  quicker  time  to  market. Great at finding bottlenecks and easy to use.  We  used  App  Dynamics  originally  for  application  performance  monitoring  of  our  custom  websites  and  applications.  We \"didn t\",  know  where  the  slow-downs  were  happening.  The  up/down  way  of  monitoring \"wasn t\",  enough  for  us,  so  the  slowness,  machine  learning  and  baselining  was  really  nice.  Seeing  successful,  yet  slow  transactions  really  helped  us  find  problems.  It  was  nice  to  see  the  \"inside-out\"  view  of  our  apps.  This  was  an  added  service,  so  though  it \"wasn t\",  fully  deployed,  we  used  it  across  various  departments  for  a  variety  of  applications.  Seeing  user  experience  was  also  very  helpful.  We  purchased  the  end-user  monitoring  portion  of  it  to  capture  \"outside-in\"  and  marry  that  with  the  previous  view  from  the  APM  portion. AppDynamics - excellent application monitoring with a steep(ish) learning curve.  App  Dynamics  is  used  to  provide  application  performance  monitoring  for  our  ecommerce  booking  website  and  external  APIs,  providing  a  valuable  tool  to  ensure  the  application  is  working  as  it  should,  particularly  in  terms  of  performance  -  especially  response  time,  etc.  Alerting  from  App  Dynamics  is  used  to  ensure  any  production  issues  are  dealt  with  swiftly  and  it  is  also  used  for  error  monitoring  and  analysis. Appdynamics review.  Kedron  partners  with  appdynamics  to  deliver  application  performance  monitoring  and  business  transaction  monitoring  for  modern  application  architectures  in  both  cloud  and  data  centre.  [We  are]  delivering  solutions  for  highly  demanded  distributed,  dynamic  and  agile  environments. The future of monitoring!.  App  Dynamics  is  a  great  application.  It  has  helped  us  detect  application  bugs,  hardware  problems  (based  on  trends)  and  network  issues  within  our  network.  Currently,  our  supply  chain  is  using  App  Dynamics. AppD Great Features Poor Support and Stability.  App  D  is  used  by  our  operations  department  to  track  and  identify  issues  in  our  SOA  web  services  stack  written  in  .Net.  Prior  to  App  D  we  had  no  insight  into  performance  or  health  of  our  environment. New user and new environment implementation..  Production  support  and  dev  ops  use  App  Dynamics  primarily  to  troubleshoot  issues  in  our  production  environment.  Additionally  we  have  created  custom  graphs  which  provide  telemetry  on  our  crucial  tiers.  This  is  composed  of  error  rates,  response  times  and  load  for  our  middle,  web  and  backend  tiers. Cisco SD-WAN: Taking the lead!.  Cisco  SD-WAN  provides  the  ability  to  manage  connectivity  across  WANs  from  a  single  dashboard  which  simplifies  the  total  work,  from  day  to  day  operations  and  preventive/reactive  monitoring.

We  are  currently  using  SD-WAN  in  way  that  it  likely \"wasn t\",  originally  intended.  While  the  main  purpose  of  SD-WAN  is  to  provide  reliability  over  multiple  data  paths/mediums, \"we ve\",  largely  been  using  it  as  a  DMVPN  for  telecommuters.  But  unlike  traditional  VPNs  or  DMVPNs,  this  always-on  method  includes  added  layers  of  security,  higher  throughput,  and  the  added  benefit  of  Qo  S.  (Yes,  Qo  S \"doesn t\",  do  anything  over  the  internet,  but  with  this  we  can  limit  throughput  and  still  give  outbound  priority  to  things  like  Voice  so \"they re\",  out  first  and  less  likely  to  be  dropped.)  Especially  in  the  current  environment  of  COVID-19  where  so  many  are  staying  at  home  and  working  from  home  and  streaming  entertainment  from  the  internet,  there  is  a  lot  of  congestion  going  on  out  there  and  every  benefit  is  worth  it.

We  use  Meraki  MX  as  a  security  appliance/firewall.  With  an  advanced  security  license,  the  content  filtering,  IDS,  and  geographical  blocking  features  are  surprisingly  good  compared  to  using  alternative  solutions  with  no  noticeable  performance  hit  as  long  as  you  size  the  unit  properly.  The  geographical  blocking  is  a  great  security  feature  but  you  have  to  use  with  planning.  I’ve  managed  to  block  a  few \"vendors \",  websites  and  mail  servers  without  realizing  what  country  those  vendors  were  located  in.  When  you’re  not  use  to  having  geographical  blocking  the  first  time  I  I  had  that  problem  it  took  a  while  to  troubleshoot  why  the  connectivity  was  missing.  Sorta  over  secured  myself.  Not  the  MX’s  fault. Firewalling With Ease.  Transitioning  from  traditional  firewalls  to  Meraki  branded  firewalls  was  more  of  an  opportunity  to  enhance  \"usability\"  while  still  maintaining  the  strong  Cisco  name.

We  recently  purchased  a  Meraki  MX  Firewall  for  our  organization  as  we  are  growing  and  need  a  more  heavy  duty  piece  of  equipment  that  can  handle  all  our  traffic.  This  Firewall  is  being  used  across  the  whole  organization  although  most  users  have  no  idea  it  is  being  used  or  what  a  firewall  is  or  does.  We  bought  this  product  because  our  older  firewalls  were  no  longer  able  to  handle  our  growing  traffic  and  was  dropping  packets  or  crashing  altogether.  So  far  our  Cisco  Meraki  MX  Firewall  has  been  perfect  and  have  had  no  issues. Cisco Meraki and Why it will make your life simpler.

I  used  to  have  to  restart  our  router  and  check  for  updates  and  fix  things  on  a  weekly  or  daily  basis  now  I  may  visit  my  console  twice  a  month  as  the  firewall  takes  care  of  itself.

We  found  ourselves  in  this  situation  a  couple  of  years  ago  and  after  doing  some  research  settled  on  the  Cisco  Meraki  MX  Firewall  series.  As  of  right  now  we  only  have  one  but  we  are  looking  at  possibly  adding  them  to  our  other  facilities  as  they  age.  I  highly  recommend  purchasing  the  Advanced  Security  License  as  that  adds  content  filtering,  anti-virus  scanning  and  intrusion  detection.  We  saw  a  huge  drop  in  virus  and  malware  infections  right  after  upgrading  our  license. \"We ve\",  been  very  happy  with  the  purchase  overall. Great for many small offices.  Our  business  grew  to  30  locations  in  10  countries  over  the  past  five  years,  all  these  offices  access  corporate  applications  and  cloud  services.

They  are  extremely  effective  WAN  routers  coming  in  very  useful  [for]  typical  form  factors  depending  on  HA  and  the  number  of  interface  requirements.  Typical  use  case  is  for  ethernet  circuits  less  than  1Gbps  or  TDM  such  as  T1.  Secondary  use  case  is  voice:  E&M,  FXO,  CME.  The  high-density  analog  module  gives  us  a  great  option  for  larger  analog  footprint  locations.  Tertiary  use  case  is  i  WAN  and  foreseeably  SD-WAN. Cisco ISRs.  Allowing  my  company  to  process  and  serve  customer  products.  We  use  Cisco  Routers  in  our  core  environment  and  for  our  customer  premise  locations.  We  deploy  these  ISRs  with  MPLS  Service  Providers  and  DMVPN  deployments.  It  allows  us  to  extend  services  and  support  to  our  products  at  customer  sites.  They  are  currently  used  by  several  departments. Cisco Routers.  With  the  flexibility  of  ISR  routers,  they  are  being  used  throughout  my  organization  for  a  number  of  uses.  We  use  them  for  voice,  branch  office,  WAN  edge,  cloud  edge,  and  other  things. Finally a router worth keeping.  Cisco  Routers  are  in  use  to  provide  support  for  multi-protocol  routing  and  basic  ACL  functionality.  They  provide  our  BUs  with  reliable  connectivity  options  to  the  internet  and  branch  locations. Review A1.

We  resell  Cisco  Routers  to  our  customers  to  be  deployed  at  their  respective  branches.  These  are  being  used  by  all  of  our  customers.  There  are  no  problems  using  Cisco  Routers  other  than \"bug s\",  related  to  IOS  software. Cisco Routers Review.  [They  are  used  for]  Full  layer  3  and  redundant  reliability  at  core  and  distribution  levels. Cisco Routers are a Must for any Enterprise.  We  exclusively  utilize  Cisco  for  routing,  switching,  and  Wi  Fi.  While  we  still  have  some  legacy  2821,  2921,  and  3900-series  routers  in  our  large  enterprise,  the  current  standards  are  -  Telecommuters  (881)  -  Small-to-Medium  sites  (ISR  4k)  -  Large  Hospitals/Office  Buildings  and  Internet  Edge  (ASR  1000). My Cisco Umbrella Review.  It  provides  us  control  of  employee  and  guest  user  access  over  internal  and  guest  wireless.  Also,  delivers  control  over  Internet  browsing.  With  it,  we  able  to  have  another  defense  layer  for  all  our  users  and  guests  through  filtering  URLs  and  domains  of  malicious  and  suspicious  sites.  We  also  integrate  with  our  SIEM  for  notable  events,  alerting,  dashboards,  reporting,  and  monitoring  of  our  wireless  users. Cisco Umbrella Review.  We  installed  Cisco  Umbrella  over  2  years  ago.  We  decided  to  use  it  because  we  needed  one  good  solution  to  give  us  the  best  security  across  the  whole  company.  And \"we ve\",  had  great  success.  Now  we  are  able  to  protect  our  users  and  our  network  with  the  best  solution  on  the  market.  Thank  You,  Cisco! Cisco Umbrella - Guest Protection.  I  have  deployed  Cisco  Umbrella  to  provide  control  of  what  content  guest  users  have  access  to  when  using  guest  wireless  and  browsing  the  internet.  It  also  provides  an  added  layer  of  security  to  the  guest  users  by  filtering  DNS  of  malicious  sites.  I  integrated  Cisco  Umbrella  directly  through  APIs  into  the  Meraki  Cloud  dashboard,  providing  centralized  control  and  configuration  of  policies  for  the  guest  users. Umbrella: Network security for an organization with many small sites. \"We re\",  using  the  Cisco  Umbrella  across  our  organization.  The  main  usage  is  for  IT  Accounting  and  transparency—filtering  unwanted  and  inappropriate  content  across  the  whole  organization.  As  not  our  infrastructure  is  SD-WAN  ready  and  several  brand  routers,  we  need  a  solution  that  can  be  deployed  cross-brand. Cisco Umbrella Review.  In  our  company,  we  have  been  using  Cisco  Umbrella  to  protect  each  site  in  Argentina  and  Brazil  (+160  locations)  for  more  than  2  years  and  in  more  than  2500  roaming  clients. Easy to deploy and great application insights.  We  use  Cisco  Umbrella  for  all  our  staff.  We  are  a  small  company  and  generally  work  from  home  so  our  laptops  are  not  centrally  managed.  Having  Cisco  Umbrella  filter  our  DNS  requests  help  to  protect  all  of  us  to  ensure  that  anything  that  gets  onto  our  machines  cannot  get  back  out  to  the  less  acceptable  corners  of  the  internet  without  prior  approval. Cisco Umbrella: Simple to use, simply get it.  This  is  being  used  enterprise-wide  for  both  our  internal  endpoints  as  well  as  our  guest-WIFI  networks.  Umbrella  allows  us  to  provide  a  consistent  policy  to  all  these  endpoints  without  requiring  all  traffic  to  pass  through  my  entire  security  stack.  In  addition,  we  are  able  to  apply  this  policy  to  managed  endpoints  when  they  would  otherwise  be  considered  off-net. Cisco Umbrella is our Protection Shield.  We  are  using  Cisco  Umbrella  globally  for  the  whole  organization  and  divide  policies  by  departments.  It  protects  our  office  and  remote  (roaming)  computers  against  malicious  domains.  For  manufacturing  sites,  we  have  a  policy  to  restrict  internet  access  (use  allow-only  policy).  We  are  trying  to  use  all  features  of  the  Cisco  Umbrella  and  connect  Threat  Grid  and  Threat  Response. Cisco Umbrella protects us from the dark clouds of the Internet.

Cisco  Umbrella  protects  100%  of  our  users  100%  of  the  time. Umbrella Review - Keeping the Rain Out of Your Network..  First  -  Cisco  Umbrella  used  to  be  called  Open  DNS.  Cisco  bought  them.  And  of  course  had  to  rename  it  -  especially  since  it  had  OPEN  in  the  name.  LOL!  I  work  as  the  director  of  IT  for  a  mid  sized  architectural  firm.  The  architects  were  used  to  going  about  anywhere  they  wanted  on  the  web  and  when  I  started  here  I  knew  I  had  to  find  a  way  to  \"protect\"  them  without  being  too  pushy.  Open  DNS,  aka  Umbrella  has  been  a  lifesaver.  Using  their  selection  list  I  was  able  to  whittle  down  the  content  available  to  my  users  while  still  having  the  ability  to  customize  and  whitelist  sites  they  needed  to  have  access  to.  This  product  -  in  case  you \"don t\",  know  -  filters  traffic  at  the  DNS  level.  They  have  whitelist/blacklist  DNS  entries  and  for  the  most  part  it  is  totally  transparent  and  extremely  fast. Umbrella covers your back!.  Nowadays,  Connext  as  a  part  of  Migesa  Group  has  been  using  Umbrella  across  all  the  company  even  in  its  partner  companies  (capta,  Migesa,  Soft  M).  Because  we  have  more  than  7  branch  offices  in  Mexico  and  a  lot  of  travelers  and  home  workers,  Umbrella  is  a  MUST  in  each  computer  to  ensure  security  inside  and  outside  of  our  organization. The best Umbrella ever!! CISCO Umbrella.  We  are  using  Cisco  Umbrella  to  protect  our  work  stations  as  we  have  a  massive  portion  of  our  employees  working  remotely  and  outside  our  company  network.  Cisco  Umbrella  is  allowing  us  to  avoid  using  the  VPN  Connection  to  access  specific  company  sites  or  applications,  simplifying  the  way  our  non-IT  users  work. Cisco Umbrella a Security Must Have.  We  use  Cisco  Umbrella  to  secure  our  organization  tarting  with  DNS-layer  protection.  Cisco  Umbrella  helps  us  starting  at  the  Internet  layer  to  block  malicious  and  unwanted  domains,  IP  addresses,  and  cloud  applications  before  a  connection  is  ever  established.  We  have  the  ability  to  approve  apps  for  or  organization  and  see  what  is  being  blocked  in  real  time. Cisco Umbrella Review.  We  are  using  it  for  resolving  URL,  DNS  malware  protection,  evaluating  the  web  proxy.  We  started  the  POC  on  a  single  part  of  the  company  and  we  extended  it  to  the  entire  organization.  We  are  looking  forward  to  deploying  some  appliances  to  detect  which  machines  are  trying  to  resolve  malicious  websites. My Cisco Umbrella Review.  Cisco  Umbrella  is  being  used  organization-wide  amongst  all  of  our  departments.  It  helps  us  serve  as  our  \"first  line  of  defense\"  against  internet  and  firewall  threats. Cisco Umbrella Review.  It  is  being  used  across  our  organization  and  several  clients,  we  use  Cisco  Umbrella  for  workstation  protection. Hop under my umbrella!.  We  use  Umbrella  as  a  content  filter  and  for  malware  protection  across  the  whole  organization  when  endpoints  are  not  behind  one  of  our  central  firewalls.  I  like  the  ease  of  deployment,  the  rich  statistics  it  supplies,  and  the  great  AMP  integration.  It  also  protects  our  VPN  users  when  they  are  not  connected. Umbrella DNS Filtering for Everyone.  We  are  using  Cisco  Umbrella  for  DNS  Security  and  URL  filtering.  Our  entire  organization  uses  DNS  forwarded  to  Cisco  Umbrella.  Our  mobile  users  use  the  Cisco  Umbrella  profile  loaded  into  the  Cisco  Secure  Mobility  Client  to  protect  both  inside  and  outside  the  firewall.  Cisco  Umbrella  adds  another  layer  of  security  to  our  multi-layered  setup  at  an  affordable  price. An MSP Perspective on Cisco Umbrella.  We  use  Cisco  Umbrella  internally  and  are  also  use  it  as  an  important  security  tool  for  most  of  our  customers.  We  use  it  for  DNS  encryption/web  security  as  well  as  content  filtering. Cisco Umbrella Has You Covered!.  Our  company  uses  Cisco  Umbrella  client  to  filter  web  content  that  we  do  not  want  to  leave  accessible  for  public  consumption.  We  filter  websites  and  other  content  by  category  and  we  white  list  sites  that  we  want  to  allow  for  one  reason  or  another. Game Changer!.  Cisco  Umbrella  allowed  us  to  gain  visibility  on  how  the  web  is  being  used  in  our  organization.  It  allows  us  to  immediately  protect  against  malware,  phishing,  and  gives  us  command  and  control  over  our  network  and  mobile  users! Cisco Umbrella, formely OpenDNS in daily use.  It  is  used  for  DNS  security  at  our  servers  and  clients.  All  clients  are  secured  by  Umbrella  and  the  ISOC  is  operating  the  service.  With  Umbrella  we  have  a  higher  security  level  for  our  clients,  because  the  very  critical  destinations  are  filtered  and  the  client  can  not  access  the \"source.[It s]\",  very  easy  to  use  at  firewalls  and  routers,  too. Cisco Umbrella.  We  use  Cisco  Umbrella  for  DNS  protection  on  workstations.  The  performance  of  Umbrella  is  impressive  for  it  is  a  cloud-native  service  since  day  one. \"It s\",  a  smart  proxy  that  only  routes  the  traffic  to  risky  destinations  through  its  network  and  the  safe  content  is  accessed  directly  with  no  delay.  Roaming  users  are  protected  when  they  are  on  or  off  the  corporate  network  by  installing  a  light  client.  The  problem  is  that  there  is  still  no  support  for  roaming  Android  and  Linux  devices. Cisco Umbrella for the win!.  For  us  the  decision  came  down  to  figuring  out  how  to  manage  our  zone  data  and  getting  control  of  how  employees  were  accessing  the  internet.  The  Enterprise  has  the  responsibility  to  defend  its  little  corner  of  the  Internet  and  Umbrella  provided  the  capability  to  achieve  that.  Having  that  visibility  to  know  what  systems  are  looking  up  in  the  DNS  provides  valuable  information  that  can  feed  behavior  analytics  that  drives  a  portion  of  our  security  process.  It  also  provides  an  added  layer  of  protection  by  having  mechanisms  to  block  access  to  known  malicious  domains  and  URLs,  a  plus  for  any  company  looking  to  combat  the  biggest  issues  we  face  as  network  defenders  -  phishing. Umbrella: The only way to go..  We  implemented  Cisco  Umbrella  as  a  means  to  protect  our  environment  from  drive-by  downloads,  malware,  and  viruses  in  the  wild.  Since  implementation,  we  have  decreased  our  occurrences  by  approximately  70%.  This  system  is  so  easy  to  implement  and  requires  very  little  time  on  a  daily  basis  and  protects  the  environment  before  anything  ever  gets  to  the  network. Cisco Umbrella - Good DNS Protection.  We  use  Cisco  Umbrella  for  DNS  protection  on  workstations  by  using  the  roaming  client  on  endpoints,  and  we  also  use  the  virtual  machines  that  integrate  with  Active  Directory  for  DNS  protection  on  a  network.  It  provides  protection  against  potentially  malicious  websites  and  known  bad  servers  on  the  Internet. Umbrella provides powerful cloud-based top-level filtering and protection for all kinds of networks. \"We ve\",  been  using  this  in  our  department  since  it  was  Open  DNS,  and  use  it  primarily  to  protect  users  who  are  connecting  on-site  or  remotely  from  stumbling  into  or  exposing  our  network  to  problematic  content,  especially  malware,  etc.  Because  we  have  a  diverse  range  of  users  on  the  network,  many  of  whom  bring  their  own  devices, \"it s\",  helpful  to  have  DNS-level  security  rather  than  count  on  everyone  to  use  safe  internet  practices. Umbrella, worth it\\'s weight for sure.  We  are  an  MSP  with  7000  endpoints  that  we  support.  Umbrella  is  not  optional  for  our  clients.  While  antivirus  is  required,  it  serves  as  a  checkbox.  Umbrella  is  what  does  all  of  the  heavy  lifting  for  us  on  the  antimalware  side  of  things. Cisco Umbrella.  Cisco  Umbrella  was  added  as  a  first  layer  of  defense,  we  are  using  2  Layers  of  Proxies,  first  commonly  used  web  filtering  (WSA)  and  second  on  the  top  of  this  is  Umbrella  which  protect  our  company  on  a  DNS  level Useful for rapid Investigations.  I  used  Cisco  Umbrella  during  the  Wanna  Cry  Campaign  to  check  if  some  of  our  customers  were  affected  and  block  all  the  DNS  requests  on  time.  We  also  found  several  other  indications  of  compromises  that  helped  us  to  localize  other  infections  on  endpoints  and  correctly  review  our  security  policies. Cisco Umbrella keeps you protected.  Cisco  Umbrella  is  used  across  our  whole  organization  to  protect  the  network  from  malicious  web  traffic  that  might  be  due  to  malware,  crypto  mining,  command  and  control,  phishing  or  other  sources.  With  the  virtual  umbrella  appliances  connected  to  our  AD,  we  can  identify  the  computers  that  might  be  infected,  but  stopped  from  talking  to  the  outside,  and  get  them  cleaned  quickly. \"It s\",  an  important  layer  of  DNS  security. One of the best decisions we ever made..  We  made  the  decision  to  purchase  Cisco  Umbrella  (when  it  was  Open  DNS)  in  2014  and  implement  it  for  over  2000  endpoints  as  an  additional  protection  from  malware  and  phishing.  We  saw  the  time  our  MSP  spent  on  these  types  of  issues  plummet,  from  a  few  incidents  a  month  to  a  handful  per  year.  Money  extremely  well  spent.  We  believed  so  much  in  the  ROI,  we  paid  for  this  service  ourselves  as  a  cost  saving  measure.  I \"don t\",  think \"we ll\",  ever  not  use  this  service! Great product and a must have for any organizatioin..  We  currently  use  Cisco  Umbrella  as  our  first  line  of  defense  against  threats  from  the  internet.  It  is  currently  being  used  across  the  organization  and  addresses  many  problems  around  current  and  emerging  threats  and  protects  us  against  the  phishing,  malware,  and  ransomware. Cisco Umbrella. OpenDNS..  Used  within  remote  offices,  offsetting  the  smart  filtering  into  the  cloud  instead  of  on-premise.  Good  hybrid  approach  with  Cisco  AMP.  Protects  from  malicious  call-backs  and  real  time  web-filtering  that  is  policy  based. OpenDNS Web Filtering is amazing! Easy!.  Open  DNS  Umbrella  Web  Filtering  is  being  used  by  HSL  to  help  implement  ISO  27001:2013.  It  helps  us  meet  certain  filtering  requirements  required  to  pass  audit  and  obtain  certification.

For  stores  our  wireless  infrastructure  is  used  for  business  applications  and  also  for  client  navigation.  For  our  distribution  center \"it s\",  part  of  its  core,  for  product  registration  and  wireless  telephony,  and  in  the  corporate  offices \"it s\",  used  for  mobility  within  the  areas  for  laptops  and  cell  phones. Cisco Meraki MR Wireless Access Points.  The  Cisco  Meraki  Wireless  Access  Points  in  our  office  are  in  use  across  the  entire  organization.  It  provides  full,  secure  wireless  coverage  for  both  guests  and  corporate  users  and  also  provides  visibility  into  what  is  happening  on  the  wireless  networks. Great Security Feature Set and Easy to Use and Deploy!.  Meraki  is  being  used  across  our  entire  organization,  which  includes  offices  from  the  West  Coast  to  the  East  Coast.  We  use  it  to  manage  our  domain  and  guest  access.  It  is  scalable  and  easy  to  use. A great solution for schools.  We  use  Meraki  ccess  points  exclusively  in  our  school  district.  We  currently  have  about  550  access  points  spread  between  15  locations.  Most  of  these  access  points  are  in  classrooms,  but  we  also  have  them  in  offices,  large  spaces  such  as  gyms  and  auditoriums,  as  well  as  on  the  outside.  We  have  been  able  to  cover  just  about  any  area  we  want  with  some  combination  of  Meraki \"AP s\",  and  antennas,  including  a  bus  compound  where  buses  wirelessly  upload  their  surveillance  videos  every  day. Easy as setting up your home network.  Mass deployment with simple setup..  It  is  being  used  for  wireless  mesh  networking  company-wide  for  when  users  complain  of  slow  network  and/or  weak  wifi  signals. Why Meraki APs?.  The  Meraki  wireless  AP  is  used  by  my  entire  organization.  The  biggest  issue  it  resolved  was  radius  (AD)  authentication.  Ease  of  management  of  the  solution  has  no  price. Meraki Experience. \"It s\",  being  used  to  provide  wireless  service  to  hundreds  of  users  in  a  large  office  building  where  there  is  a  need  to  have  roaming  access  across  different  areas. Meraki - Ease of management..  Meraki  Access  Points  are  used  across  our  entire  organization,  including  multiple  departments.  One  of  the  main  reasons  I  like  Meraki  is  that  it  is  all  managed  through  the  cloud.  I  can  pull  reports,  configure,  and  manage  Access  Points  all  over  the  place  from  my  desk.  Prior  we  had  various  vendors  in  each  building  all  with  a  different  management  client  or  protocol. Meraki Makes Wireless Easy and Fun.  If  you  read  my  other  reviews  of  Cisco  Meraki  products,  you  will  know  I  am  an  unabashed  lover  of  Meraki  cloud-managed  networking.  Just  like  the  switches  and  firewall  products  I  use,  the  Meraki  access  points  (AP)  offer  incredible  ease  of  installation,  configuration,  management,  and  monitoring.  I  use  two  of  these  to  blanket  our  office  in  Wi  Fi,  and  users  are  always  ensured  of  the  best  Wi  Fi  experience  as  they  move  around  the  office  because  the  APs  automatically  switch  devices  to  the  AP  with  the  strongest  signal  for  their  locations.  Users  are  presented  with  a  single  SSID  regardless  of  the  number  of  APs  present,  solving  the  issue  of  the  user  having  to  move  their  device  to  a  new  AP  when  the  old  one  is  out  of  range  as  they  move.  Just  like  all  the  Meraki  products  on  my  account,  I  can  configure  and  monitor  them  from  a  single  dashboard. Meraki\\'s Z3 for Remote Workers is a WIN/WIN.  Specifically,  we  are  using  the  Z3  model  WAP.  We  needed  a  better  solution  to  support  our  remote  workers  across  the  entire  firm.  The  legacy  system  the \"Merakis \",  replaced  was  very  time  consuming  to  get  a  remote  work  up  and  functional,  consumed  a  licensing  model  that  was  impossible  to  attribute  to  the  business  units  and  when  we  needed  to  redeploy  an  existing  unit,  that  caused  a  lot  of  heartache  for  both  the  end  user  as  well  as  the  networking  team. Meraki Wireless Access Points deploy and manage rapidly.  Cisco  Meraki  Wireless  is  being  used  on  a  departmental  basis,  testing  on  both  corporate  and  public  guest  wifi  scenarios.  We  are  trying  to  understand  the  capacity  limits  of  the  devices  and  whether  they  are  suitable  for  running  a  number  of  SSIDs  simultaneously. Meraki makes it EASY.  We  utilize  Cisco  Meraki  throughout  our  entire  internal  organization  as  well  as  to  provide  free  wireless  internet  to  thousands  of  residents  within  our  community.  It  addresses  the  need  for  many  access  points  being  managed  by  a  single  dashboard  to  give  us  greater  insight  into  both  usage,  as  well  as  any  sort  of  access  issues  we  encounter. Cisco Meraki Access Points are great.  Cisco  Meraki  Wireless  Access  Points  are  being  used  throughout  all  10+  of  our  different  site  locations  with  over  5,000  users  a  day  on  the  APs  combined.  Currently  we  have  almost  1  AP  in  every  room  due  to  30  +  devices  per  room  needing  wifi  connection.  The  APs  allow  us  to  set  up  guest  sign-on,  use  air  marshall  to  attack  rogue  hotspots  from  students  and  we  are  able  to  turn  on  different  SSIDs  to  each  AP  if  we  need  to. Meraki Wireless has a small business feel but big business delivery!.  Cisco  Meraki  Wireless  is  the  sole  source  for  our  wireless  coverage  for  not  only  internal  security  but  our  guest  network.  We  also  use  Cisco  Meraki  Wireless  to  provide  private \"SSID s\",  for  internal  camera  systems,  smart  TVs,  and  other  equipment.  Cisco  Meraki  Wireless  is  the  only  wireless  solution  in  a  four-floor  office  building  with  about  200  employees  serviced  by  about  20  access  points.  This  solution  addresses  all  of  our  wireless  network  needs  for  staff,  contractors,  guests,  and  dedicated  technology  uses. Cisco Meraki Wireless AP in small office environment. \"I m\",  using  Meraki  Wireless  Access  Points  in  our  customer  LAN  environment.  It  used  used  for  intra  traffic  as  well  as  for  guests  to  access  the  Internet.  With  the  Meraki  wireless  system  is  really  easy  to  separate  different  security  areas  from  each  others  with  one  centralized  management  application. Great solution for remote management, good performace if choose the correct device.  We  have  been  using  these  devices  over  than  4  years.  We  decided  to  try  them  because  cloud  management  was  very  attractive  for  us.  So  we  start  to  use  it  for  one  of  our  offices  and  the  devices  work  fine,  the  performance  is  good  but  not  the  best.  Sometimes \"it s\",  necessary  to  restart  the  devices  so  they  work  well  again.  The  configuration  is  very  simple  and  the  management  is  very  easy. Cisco Meraki AP\\'s, The Pot \\'O Gold at the end of a rainbow.  We  are  using  Cisco  Meraki  Wireless  Access  points  throughout  our  entire  enterprise.  We  primarily  utilize  it  for  fast  and  secure  wireless  access  for  our  mobile  workstations  on  our  manufacturing  floor.

Using  to  control  4  access  points  throughout  the  enterprise.  We  love  the  ease  of  use  and  the  ability  to  add  more  nodes  or  change  profiles  within  a  matter  of  moments  via  the  GUI.  While  the  CLI  is  proficient  for  most  people  the  ability  to  see  all  of  the  changes  being  implemented  before  the  change  is  superb. The most reliable, powerful and flexible Wireless Controller on the market.  Cisco  Wireless  LAN  Controllers  are  being  used  since  9  years  ago,  when  we  moved  from  a  small  deployment  of  20  or  so  access-points  being  controlled  by  1  single  master  AP,  autonomous  AP  architecture  to  a  new  approach  called  LWAPP  architecture,  where  the  Wireless  LAN  controller  manages  and  controls  all  the  AP  in  the  campus.  For  us,  it  meant  we  had  a  huge  leap  in  administration  and  allowed  us  to  increase  the  adoption  of  the  Wi  Fi  technology,  going  from  20  to  300  AP  along  the  last  9  years,  using  the  same  controller.  Besides  that,  we  could  improve  availability  having  2  controllers  working  simultaneously.  Last,  but  not  least,  we  could  serve  several  remote  offices  with  the  same  controllers,  hosted  in  our  HQ. Cisco WLC is the brain of all Wireless Networks.  We  have  almost  50k  Aironet  LWAP  that  is  controlled  via  almost  32x  8510  WLCs.

Cisco Wireless Controllers are Great (if you have money)!.  Our  organization  uses  Cisco  Wireless  controllers  to  provide  command  and  control  functions  for  our  wireless  infrastructure.  In  our  early  wireless  implementations,  the  devices  were  singularly  managed.  This  was  a  cumbersome  solution  that  made  deploying  and  managing  devices  nearly  impossible.  Now  we  use  this  to  put  out  a  centralized  and  unified  wireless  deployment  that  can  be  pushed  out  rapidly! Cisco WLC review..  Used  across  the  whole  organization  in  a  redundant  cluster  setup  between  two  Data  Centers. Yeah, Cisco Wireless!.  We  use  it  for  the  whole  organization.  It  allows  connectivity  for  devices  on  our  production  floor  and  other  places  that  we  can’t  pull  a  cable  very  easily. Cisco Wireless LAN Controller - quick and easy wireless.  We  are  using  the  Cisco  Wireless  LAN  Controller  (WLC)  to  provide  Xaa  S  for  Wireless.  A  redundant  pair  of  WLCs  are  installed  in  our  data  centers.  Customers  who  subscribe  to  our  services  have  access  points  (APs)  deployed  at  their  site  which  register  with  the  WLC  and  are  then  centrally  managed  and  monitored.Cisco  WLC  provides  central  management  and  monitoring  of  a  large  number  of  APs  across  multiple  customer  sites,  as  well  as  touchless  deployment  of  APs  with  WLC  discovery.  Self-healing  wireless  continually  monitors  the  RF  environment  and  updates  channel  or  power  assignment  based  on  interference,  holes,  etc. Cisco Wireless Controller is a Must.  We  currently  use  our  Wireless  LAN  Controllers  to  manage \"AP s\",  across  multiple  sites.  We  heavily  rely  on  Flex  Connect  which  is  an  awesome  way  to  reduce  our  carbon  presence  within  some  of  our  sites,  and  the  presence  of  Mobility  Express  opens  up  other  opportunities.The  decision  to  transition  down  such  a  path,  to  begin  with,  was  simple  -  we  needed  consolidated  management  of  the  entire  wireless  infrastructure  from  a  single  point.  I  have  not  regretted  making  this  decision  since  we  first  deployed  the  solution. Wifi Management made easier.  We  use  Cisco  Wireless  LAN  controllers  to  control  many  offices  in  our  company.  It  manages  the  ability  to  break  out  the  access  and  functionality  of  how  the  Wireless  experience  works  for  Groups,  Departments,  employees  and  guest  access.

Our  original  solution  consisted  of  several  autonomous  wireless  systems,  this  created  a  support  and  maintenance  nightmare  for  a  two-man  network  team.  I  no  longer  have  to  log  into  every  app  and  manually  configure  and  troubleshoot. Worth it, can be better.  The  rise  of  mobile  devices  has  raised  the  need  for  robust  and  secure  wireless  infrastructure.  At  early  stages,  wireless  equipment  was  labeled  as  \"nice  to  have\"  devices  but  suddenly  people  have  discovered  it  is  a  \"must  have\"  for  most  situations.  It  addresses  the  one  basic  problem,  connectivity  for  non-cabled  devices. Wirellesation.  We  use  two  wireless  controllers  (5508)  with  ISE  &  Prime  supporting  about  four  hundred  Access  Points  (1602).  Three  hundred  of  them  are  installed  at  our  stores  and  the  rest  are  installed  at  our  premises.  Most  of  the  usage  is  by  providing  internet  access  (especially  at  stores).  For  now  we  have  implemented  a  POC  with  CMX  analytics  at  our  stores  and  I  hope  to  change  the  MDM  platform  from  Mobile  Iron  to  Meraki. Cisco Wireless 2500-series: Simple and inexpensive, but effective.  We  use  Cisco  Wireless  controllers  (2504)  and  lightweight  WAPs  globally.

I  have  experience  with  the  Cisco  Catalyst  6500  series  which  is  a  chassis  system  that  uses  a  supervisor  engine  as  the  \"motor\"  behind  the  switching  power  and  I  can  tell  you  that  those  things  were  beasts.  They  could  run  forever  without  a  reboot,  and  usually  the  worst  that  would  happen  with  them  would  be  I  might  have  to  replace  a  blade  from  time  to  time.  I  also  have  experience  working  with  the  3750  and  3850  switches  which  are  modular.  Up  to  nine  of  them  can  be  power  and  data  stacked  together  and  be  used  in  the  same  way  as  one  6500  was  used.  The  3850  is  the  industry  standard  now  in  the  education  system,  as  one  access  stack  can  be  placed  in  each  building  and  it  make  supporting  the  infrastructure  much  easier  for  the  IT  department.

Save Your Time with Cisco Webex.  Used  as  a  video  conferencing  and  sharing  software  app.  Cisco  Webex  Room  Series  is  used  by  almost  all  of  our  organization.  I  have  also  used  some  similar  programs  and  I  can  easily  say  Web  Ex  is  the  best  at  this  point  in  time!  It  allows  us  to  start  and  join  meetings  easily.  In  my  department,  I  and  my  colleagues  use  it  to  discuss  quality  issues,  supply  chain  issues  or  purchasing  issues  with  our  suppliers  or  D&R  engineers.  No  matter  where  you  are,  you  can  just  click  and  have  a  meeting  with  the  person  responsible. Webex Telepresence.  Ease  of  implementing  the  room  kits  was  increased  and  designing  our  conference  rooms  was  easy.  Customer  interaction  with  the  room  kits  was  also  easy. Cisco Webex Room Series: the best product design and quality delivery..  As  a  company  that  has  several  plants  and  offices  around  the  globe,  we  started  using  Cisco  Webex  Room  kits  to  allow  our  employees  to  collaborate  without  the  need  to  travel.  We  started  selecting  some  meeting  rooms  that  had  a  potential  need  for  videoconference  and  deployed  the  video  endpoints  in  those  rooms.  Being  a  global  company  brings  some  challenges,  like  having  all  the  management  team  meetings  be  more  effective  and  more  intimate  without  having  to  bring  everyone  in  person. \"That s\",  the  main  goal  of  our  project. Makes room for the whole team!.  Cisco  Web  Ex  Room  has  seriously  helped  my  team  when  we  need  last-minute  meetings.  Our  team  often  is  spread  out  and  works  remotely  and  needs  an  easy  way  to  connect.  The  built-in  screen  in  the  conference  room  makes  video  conferencing  and  interviews  flawless  and  fast.  Love  this  product  and  its  efficiency. Good for face to face without travel.  Being  a  contract  engineering  company  with  clients  and  business  partners  across  the  globe,  we  use  Cisco  Webex  Room  Series  to  host  video  and  audio  conferences.  We  do  not  have  this  in  every  conference  room,  but  we  do  have  it  in  some  of  the  rooms  and  it  makes  it  easier  to  have  video  calls.  Whereas  with  a  laptop  camera  you  would  not  be  able  to  show  the  whole  room  and  use  the  laptop  at  the  same  time,  this  is  a  standalone  that  captures  everyone  in  the  room. Good solution if you can get past the learning curve and deal with a few technical problems along the way.  We  use  Cisco  Webex  Room  Series  across  our  entire  company  in  all  locations.  This  solution  allows  us  to  communicate  effectively  both  with  internal  communication  as  well  as  external  communication.  We  have  many  small  3  person  \"call  rooms\"  throughout  locations  for  individuals  or  small  groups  to  use  to  communicate.  These  are  used  in  part  for  employees  to  communicate  with  their  internal  global  teams.  Our  main  use  is  for  our  Sales  department  to  be  able  to  host  Webex  meetings  for  potential  customers  during  discovery  calls  and  demo  calls.  We  also  have  5-10  large  conference  rooms  fitted  with  single  or  dual  monitors  and  a  full  room  series  solution. The Webex Room Kits are a great next generation video endpoint from Cisco!.  We  have  begun  upgrading  older  conference  room  systems  companywide  to  the  Web  Ex  Room  Series.  We  have  implemented  the  Room  Kit  for  small  rooms  and  the  Room  Kit  Plus  for  our  medium/large  rooms.  The  endpoints  are  a  fantastic  all  in  one  solution  for  video  and  audio  conferencing  needs.  They  also  eliminate  the  needs  for  many  external  AV  devices  because  the  units  can  handle  a  majority  of  the  signal  processing  needs. Great solution for efficient online meetings.  I  have  used  the  Cisco  Web  Ex  Room  solution  in  a  global  consulting  project  for  a  time  period  of  several  weeks  which  included  tasks  that  were  required  to  be  communicated  with  teams  across  three  time-zones.  The  solution  was  present  only  on  the  main  site,  however,  people  were  able  to  connect  to  the  conferences  even  without  the  \"base  unit\"  using  just  their  webcam.  Unlike  the  older  solutions  I  have  used  in  the  past  years  (e.g.  Polycom),  \"this  solution  works\"  and  it  is  easy  to  operate,  starts  quickly  and  causes  no  stress  by  meetings. Cisco WebEx.  Cisco  Web  Ex  basically  replaced  Skype  for  Business  at  Cerner.  It  replaced  the  calls  and  the  conference  ID  that  was  needed  to  share  with  the  participants.  It  also  replaced  the  need  to  share  passwords  as  pins  and  also  increased  the  security  and  quality  of  calls.  Also,  it  has  ton  of  features  like  screen  sharing,  adding  multiple  people,  audio  -  video  support,  etc. Do you have Room for a Room Series.

The  Room  Series  endpoints  allow  us  the  ability  to  interface  these  video  requirement  in  to  the  other  technology  used  within  our  courtrooms. Best Video Collaboration Solution Available - Cisco Spark Room Series.  I  was  first  introduced  to  Cisco  Spark  Room  kits  during  the  Cisco  Live  2017.  We  purchased  our  first  unit  about  a  month  later.  This  was  set  up  for  one  of  our  smaller  remote  office  around  10  people.  The  technology  built  into  this  unit  is  amazing  and  setup  was  a  breeze.  We  have  multiple  other  models  of  Cisco  Telepresence  systems  and  by  far  this  has  been  the  best  unit  Cisco  has  developed.  Video  conferencing  is  becoming  essential  to  the  way  we  do  business.

We  use  Meraki  Switches  as  our  distribution  switches  across  our  160  acre  campus.  These  switches  have  changed  our  networking  workflow  entirely.  The  insight  that  the  web  GUI  offers  our  small  team  of  admins  makes  managing  the  spread  out  network  that  we  have  very  easy  to  manage  and  maintain.  It  also  makes  switch  and  port  configuration  a  quick  and  easy  task  for  even  inexperienced  network  admins. The right choice for remote offices.  I  currently  deploy  the  Meraki  MS  switches  at  sites  where  there  are  few  or  no  IT  staff.The  typical  use  case  that  I’ve  deployed  is  for  sites  in  the  10  -  300  user  range.  For  sites  bigger  than  100  users  I’ll  typically  install  a  Cisco  Catalyst  core  and  use  the  Meraki  as  access  switches,  especially  in  wiring  closets.  If  the  site  is  small  I’ll  typically  deploy  a  couple  of  these  devices  to  account  for  potential  failure  scenarios.  Ensuring  that  the  internet  connectivity  on  remote  sites  is  \"robust\"  is  extremely  important  as  this  connectivity  is  required  to  manage  the  devices. Meraki MS Switches are excellent for campus distribution switching.  We  have  about  30  Meraki  MS  Switches,  with  between  one  and  four  at  each  of  our  15  plants.  They  serve  as  our  primary  campus  distribution  switches,  although  we  do  not  use  them  in  our  headquarters  network  \"core\",  where  we  have  a  pair  of  Cisco  Nexus  C93108TC-EX  in  a  failover  configuration.  We  needed  a  VPN  mesh  across  the  enterprise  for  distribution  (inside  one  large  domain-based  network)  and  we \"didn t\",  want  to  have  to  spend  a  great  deal  of  time  establishing  VPN  tunnels  between  every  single  site  (to  every  single  other  site),  so  we  went  with  Meraki  for  their  ease  of  use  and  quick  configuration.

We  utilize  varying  Cisco  Meraki  Switches  in  our  infrastructure.  The  type  of  switch  depends  completely  on  the  needs  of  the  business  unit  where  the  implementation  will  occur.  For  instance,  we  have  spoke  switches,  small  retail  switches,  large  hub  switches  and  enterprise-grade  corporate  facility  switches. Ideal cloud managed switches.  We  are  using  Cisco  Meraki  switches  at  all  of  our  remote  sites,  this  enables  us  to  easily  manage  these  sites,  giving  us  the  ability  to  quickly  make  switch  port  changes  without  the  need  for  complicated  CLI  commands.

I  use  a  total  of  five  Meraki  MS  switches  across  my  organization:  two  10G  switches  (MS425-16)  and  three  1G  switches  (MS225-48).  The  10G  switches  are  16  port  models  that  provide  networking  for  a  Nutanix  cluster,  while  the  1G  switches  power  my  network  for  workstations,  printers,  APs,  etc.  Like  all  Meraki  products,  they  are  cloud-managed  devices,  enabling  me  to  monitor  and  configure  them  from  anywhere  I  have  Internet  access.

We  currently  have  no  other  solution  in  place  to  support  the  network  outside  of  Meraki  and  for  good  reason!

We  have  over  13  CISCO  switches  in  our  environment.  We  have  8  port  switches  to  48  ports  switches,  including  some  fiber  switches  for  our  campus  area  network.  When  I  started  this  project  to  switch  over  to  Meraki,  we  had  three  different  switch  vendors  and  3  different  ISP  connections  on  our  campus.  I  would  have  to  walk  over  to  each  physical  network  and  log  in  to  check  out  and  troubleshoot.  I  first  switched  the  firewalls  of  the  individual  network  and  Meraki  to  manage  everything  in  one  single  place.  I  did  not  have  to  walk  anymore  to  those  networks  and  I  then  saw  everything  in  one  plane  of  glass.  Just  recently  I  replace  all  of  my  switches  over  to  Meraki  and  it  is  great.  I  also  dropped  one  of  the  ISP  connections  because  I  am  able  to  manage  guest  access  better.

We  have  a  client  that  uses  Cisco  Webex  Calling  and  we  regularly  participate  on  the  calls  using  this  service.  We  use  the  service  to  meet  and  collaborate  on  a  regular  basis. Collaboration and Support- Two pillars of Cisco Webex.  While  I  was  working  with  my  organization  we  were  having  operational/financial  challenges  in  conducting  meetings  at  our  remote  locations  scattered  throughout  the  world.  It  was  a  huge  cost  impediment  when  there  was  a  requirement  of  a  short  duration  KT  session  or  company-wide  townhalls.  It  was  not  feasible  previously  to  conduct  it  at  one  go.  Cisco  Webex  was  our  best  choice  to  fix  this  problem  and  to  foster  our  relationship  with  Cisco.  It  comes  in  so  handy  and  is  easy  to  use.  Users  get  connected  easily  and  with  no  glitches. We don\\'t use many functions but for basic calls it gets it done.  We  use  it  to  schedule  calls  among  parties  of  2+.  We  also  use  it  for  client  meetings/calls  when  we  have  larger  parties  or  team  members  are  on  the  road. Great Communication Tool.  Webex  is  a  standard  within  meeting  applications  via  audio  and  video.  Our  clients  demand  this  application  from  us,  mainly  from  the  IT  area,  so  we  use  it  very  often.  It  is  a  simple  and  intuitive  application  and  no  specific  knowledge  is  necessary  for  its  use. Cloud-based phone system.  Cisco  Webex  Calling  allows  us  to  hold  work  meetings  with  our  main  customers.  It  is  very  useful  not  to  have  to  install  or  maintain  practically  anything.  It  is  used  by  the  IT  software  department  to  which  I  belong  and  allows  screen  sharing,  documentation,  etc. One of the best SMB products available.  We  currently  have  limited  options  in  Argentina  regarding  all  the  features  available  for  this  product  in  other  locations,  but  as  a  Cisco  voice  service  family  product, \"it s\",  always  among  the  top-recommended  choices  for  use  and  resale  to  customers,  with  no  blind  spots  when  selected  and  all  of \"Cisco s\",  expertise  and  support  behind  it. Nexus -- Warp Speed Networking.  Our  organization  uses  Cisco  Nexus  devices  in  our  data  center  as  both  our  spine  and  leaf  layers.  These  solve  several  problems  for  us:  most  notably,  the  packet  forwarding  is  fantastic,  but  additionally,  the  simplicity  of  these  devices  having  advanced  troubleshooting  tools  and  a  usable  programming  interface  (NX-API)  really  makes  them  quite  valuable  to  our  team. Cisco Nexus in service provider DC.  Cisco  Nexus  switches  are  in  the  heart  of  our  data  centre  providing  an  ACI  software  controlled  fabric  as  well  in  a  Nexus-OS  software  controlled  [environment].  Multiple  fabrics  provide  multiple  location  connectivity  layers  to  our  capacity  hosts.  APIC  controlled  Nexus  fabric  day  2  operation  is  fully  automated  so  that  only  one-time  onboarding  infrastructure  typed  configurations  are  done  via  an  APIC  controller  cluster. Cisco Nexus rocks! Which is the usual when it comes to Cisco!.  We  use  Cisco  Nexus  for  HA  and  as  L3  for  our  backbone  network.  It  rocks  when  it  comes  to  high  availability  and  stability. Why Coveo chose Cisco Nexus for its core network.  We  use  2  Cisco  Nexus  as  our  core  switches  for  our  datacenter  location.  The  servers  in  this  location  are  that  is  left  of  our  on-premises  infrastructure.  We  wanted  Nexus  because  we  wanted  something  that  was  able  to  manage  multiple  10Gbps  links  and  we  wanted  something  with  renowned  reliability. Nexus Pros and Cons in a nut shell.  Cisco  Nexus  is  a  very  optimal  solution  for  data  centers  that  are  still  running  on  legacy  architecture  or  the  new  cutting  edge  technologies  like  datacenter  virtualization.  The  beauty  of  this  particular  product  is  Cisco  took  all  the  pain  in  the  background  for  the  new  technologies  in  the  datacenter  infrastructure  and  they  left  it  with  straightforward  configuration  and  architectural  solutions  to  the  industry.  So  we  get  optimal  solutions  with  less  effort,  coming  to  the  hardware.  This  state  of  the  art  hardware  handles  very  high  density  data  along  with  virtualization. Cisco Nexus - The Data Center Switch for the Next Generation.  Cisco  Nexus  switches  are  being  used  as  core  devices  and  data  center  server  access  switches  throughout  our  company.  These  switches  provide  high  throughput  and  density,  with  very  little  carbon  footprint.  The  variety  of  switches  you  can  purchase  in  the  Nexus  line  is  also  a  bonus.  Our  users  want  to  be  able  to  access  data  as  quickly  as  possible,  with  fault  transparency.  The  Cisco  Nexus  line  of  switches  provides  that  capability.  The  modular  switches  allow  my  team  to  get  exactly  what  type  of  access  is  needed,  without  having  to  buy  multiple  switches. Nexus: Great value, dense, and flexible!.  We  use  our  Nexus  5548UPs  for  10G  switched  connectivity  for  our  compute  as  well  as  for  routing  over  our  WAN,  to  our  ISP,  and  to  other  1G  network  infrastructure. Cisco Nexus datacenter workhorse.  We  needed  to  take  the  step  to  [move  to]  10Gigabit,  and  doing  so  on  the  Nexus  platform  is  considerably  cheaper  then  on  the  Catalyst  6500  platform.  Furthermore  we  were  looking  into  converged  networks  that  were  very  suitable  with  the  Nexus  line  of  switches,  which  we  later  abandoned  (not  due  to  Nexus).  Lastly  the  Nexus  line  of  switches  were  built  for  the  datacenter  where  we  needed  the  10G  aggregation,  and  all  the  good  features  like  lower  latency,  port-profiles,  ISSU,  FEX,  etc. Cisco Yay or Nay.  It  provides  a  higher  level  of  communication  and  easier  streamlining  throughout  our  organization.  The  retention  of  data  and  easy  access  helps  especially  during  a  new  work  from  home  environment.  Every  user  has  full  access  and \"it s\",  fairly  easy  to  navigate  through.  It  has  additional  integrations  that  could  help  larger  organizations. UCS B-servers: An excellent workhorse for your datacenter..  We  have  moved  our  entire  virtual  environment  (~1000  virtual  servers)  to  Cisco  UCS  B  servers.  We  have  40  physicals  blades  which  provide  all  the  computing  power.  For  our  customers,  we  host  a  virtual  desktop  environment  complete  with  application  servers,  E-mail  server,  and  file/print  servers.  We  have  stopped  using  all  other \"vendors \",  servers  because  of  the  great  scalability  and  ease  of  maintenance  of  our  UCS  environment. Excellent compatibility with VMWare.  We  have  a  VMware  cluster  hosted  by  5  Cisco  UCS  servers  UCSB-B200-M4  running  more  than  100  VM.  They  work  perfectly,  the  performance  is  perfect,  and  we  have  some  critical  workload  there.  The  virtual  machines  hosted  are  from  different  departments  and  give  several  services  to  all  of  the  companies,  some  are  for  internal  use  and  others  are  for  clients. My Cisco UCS Series Review.  We  have  many  racked  Cisco  UCS  servers  in  our  datacenter.  We  use  it  in  IT  and  Web  infrastructure,  services,  database,  virtualization,  file  sharing,  and  public  cloud.  Rack  UCS  servers  are  based  on  Intel  Xeon  chips  and  are  fully  compatible  with  other  systems  already  deployed  and  older  than  we  have.  It  has  facilitated  and  contributed  a  lot  to  our  IT  team  due  to  its  reliability. Its the same Cisco hardware you\\'ve come to love.  Cisco  UCS  is  being  used  throughout  our  organization  as  our  default  server  architecture.  Cisco  is  used  for  the  majority  of  our  network  backbone  so  when  we  were  upgrading  from  HP  and  Dell  servers  we  decided  to  test  out  Cisco.  It  solves  our  problem  of  having  full  sized  servers  as \"we ve\",  moved  all  to  blades  and  chassis. Cisco USC servers are the only choice for Cisco CUCM cluster hosts.  Cisco  UCS  servers  are  the  underlying  host  servers  for  our  Cisco  CUCM  (voice  /  conferencing  /  meeting  /  chat  services)  clusters  both  for  our  publisher  CUCM  cluster  and  our  subscriber  CUCM  cluster.  They  are  beefy,  powerful,  private-labeled  HP  servers  (they  are  actually  manufactured  by  HP  and  Cisco  simply  slaps  the  UCS  label  on  them)  and  very  well-supported  servers  as  long  as  you  pay  for  the  Smart  Net  on  them  until  you  stop  using  them.  I  love  these  servers  and  I  really  wish  I  could  afford  to  have  them  everywhere,  but  I \"can t,\",  they  are  just  too  expensive,  so  they  only  house  our  phone  server  clusters. A real centralized management and deployment.  At  first  we  deployed  UCS  B-series  into  our  Datacenter  to  host  our  production  virtual  machines.  All  is  managed  throw  UCS  Central.  After  some  training  and  initial  configuration,  adding  new  blade  take  a  couple  of  minutes.  It  has  deeply  decrease  human  action  issues  and  administration  time.  This  year  we  have  deployed  a  new  UCS  Mini  at  a  remote  production  site.  Configuration  was  prepared  before  devices  purchasing  and  so  deployment  was  very  fast  and  secured. Cisco UCS B-Series, is it worth it?.  Cisco  UCS  B  Series  is  supporting  on-premises  resources  such  as  hosting  VMs  for  file  sharing  and  also  testing  environments.  Has  allowed  us  to  condense  space  but  still  take  advantage  of  high  performing  devices.  Our  downtime  has  reduced  due  to  smooth  VM  transferring  processes  without  corruption  or  compromising  of  data. Brief Overview of Cisco UCS.  We  use  Cisco  UCS  B  Series  as  the  primary  computer  platform  for  our  organization.  We  are  essentially  100%  virtualized,  and  it  complements  our  VMWare  environment  very  well. UCS - Automated and dependable. What more do you need?.  UCS  C-Series  is  being  used  by  our  organization  as  a  multi-tenanted  cloud  platform.  It  allows  us  to  deliver  cloud  solutions  to  our  various  customers  at  scale  and  with  the  dependability  that  comes  with  all  Cisco  solutions.  The  advanced  management  capabilities  allow  us  to  build  and  maintain  a  reference  design  with  minimal  effort. Servers for the digital transformation.  It  is  being  used  across  the  whole  organization.  it  address  the  following  business  problems:Port  Reduction:  The  unification  of  the  system  provided  a  platform  to  reduce  the  number  of  network  and  storage  ports  I  needed  to  consume.  Fewer  ports  meant  fewer  devices,  which  translated  into  Cap  Ex  and  Op  Ex  savings.Scalability:  The  ability  to  scale  horizontally  was  greatly  increased  by  the  architecture  of  the  UCS.  I  could  easily  add  servers  without  running  cables  to  network  and  storage  switches.Management:  The  UCS  Manager  provided  a  single  pane  of  glass  to  manage  the  entire  domain  of  UCS  servers.  Additionally,  I  could  use  the  XML  API  to  manage  the  domain  as  well.  Flexibility  wins. UCS-C 1TB RAM Review.  We  implemented  the  UCS-C  series  as  a  replacement  for  our  aging  VM  hosts.  We  went  from  running  the  entire  environment  on  12  hosts  at  roughly  70-90%  capacity  to  more  than  doubling  our  VMs  on  4  hosts  at  30-50%  capacity.  We  went  from  an  n-0  to  a  n-2  environment.  The  UCS-C  series  brought  our  environment  to  a  steady  state. Works Well for Virtualization!.  We  needed  a  system  that  would  save  us  rack  space  and  provide  us  the  power  we  needed  for  our  virtual  environment.  We  chose  the  Cisco  UCS  platform  due  to  the  space  it  would  save  us  by  using  a  blade  system.  For  about  14Us  of  space  we  could  have  8  blade  servers  to  handle  our  150  virtual  servers. Great management solution for Cisco devices.  We  are  using  Cisco  Prime  LAN  Management  Solution  in  our  network  to  monitor  and  manage  all  our  LAN  devices  in  our  HQ  and  all  our  branches.  We  used  it  to  keep  tracking  the  reachability  and  health  of  our  devices,  including  switches,  routers,  Wireless  LAN  controller  with  the  Access  points,  and  using  its  dashboard  to  keep  looking  to  our  devices  and  its  health.  Also,  we  can  use  it  to  make  a  bulk  configuration  on  a  single  device  or  many  devices  at  the  same  time. Great for Cisco wireless enviorment.  We  use  it  to  monitor  our  wireless  infrastructure/environment...  including  access  points  and  WLCs. Cisco Prime, great bang for the buck.  We  are  utilizing  Prime  at  all  our  remote  offices  on  top  of  our  current  Cisco  wireless  architecture.  We  are  utilizing  WIPS  for  security  and  also  take  advantage  of  the  Rogue  access  point  detection  functionality  on  a  quarterly  basis  to  help  detect  unauthorized  access  points. A great solution for distributed environments.  Currently,  we  use  Cisco  Prime  LAN  Management  across  the  whole  organization.  We  deployed  it  in  our  HQ,  and  from  there  we  manage  all  the  LAN  and  remote \"location s\",  sites. \"It s\",  obvious  that  for  us,  having  multiple  sites  in  different  countries,  Cisco  Prime  gives  us  a  huge  advantage.  We  can  deploy  our  configuration,  monitor  equipment,  and  generate  reports  in  one  single  pane  of  glass.  Regarding  business  aspects,  we  can  save  a  lot  of  money  on  consulting  services  remotely,  at  the  same  time  increasing  performance  solving  issues  and  getting  business  online  much  faster.

Our  IT  department  uses  it  for  remote  support  of  users  to  diagnose  issues,  install  apps  or  updates. A Great Tool For What You Need..  Our  whole  organization  utilizes  Webex  for  different  needs  that  we  have.  Webex  is  great  for  meetings  and  sharing  presentations  when  our  organization  is  spread  throughout  the  wold.  It  helps  communicate  new  changes  and  training  to  our  teams  in  other  countries.  My  primary  use  of  Webex  is  to  assisting  our  clients  with  bugs  or  troubleshooting  anything  within  our  software.  With  the  software  I  support  it  involves  looking  into  our \"client s\",  servers  and  system  because  there  can  be  so  many  factors  when  it  comes  to  other \"organization s\",  environment.This  allows  me  to  interact  with  our  client,  see  their  desktop,  and  take  control  if  I  need  to.  Sometimes  the  issues  that  we  face  when  troubleshooting  is  that  the  issue  is  complicated  and  complex.  Webex  allows  you  to  record  the  session  so  if  needed  you  can  view  it  later.  Also  the  recording  service  is  a  great  way  to  save  a  training  session  and  have  it  viewed  later  on.  The  integration  with  Microsoft  Outlook  is  a  great  feature.  It  is  easy  to  schedule  a  meeting  and  with  a  click  of  a  button  in  Outlook  i  can  add  my  Webex  info  into  the  meeting.  When  I  need  to  do  a  quick  meeting  There  is  a  \"One-Click  Meeting\"  button  in  Outlook  that  launches  a  webex  meeting  and  emails  me  the  information  that  I  can  forward  to  whomever. WebEx Remote Support - Great Design, lacks in functionality.  The  product  is  very  clean  looking.Active  X  or  Java  Connectivity  gives  a  nice  choice.Edit  Though  the  choice  is  nice,  Active  X  and  Java  controls  are  sometimes  repressed  by  paranoid  IT  people  -  connecting  can  be  time  consuming.Multiple  monitor  support  gives  you  a  toggle  and  limits  you  to  three  monitors  seen  -  problematic  if  the  customer  has  more  than  three  monitors,  or  if  you  need  to  see  all  monitors  at  once.

Catalyst  2960  X/XR  Series 2960s They Just Work!.  Catalyst  2960  X/XR  Series  Catalyst  3850  Series Cisco, Always and Forever.  Catalyst  2960  X/XR  Series Catalyst Switching - 2960-X.  Our  organization  supports  almost  16,000  students  and  over  1200  staff  members  across  12  campuses.  As  is  typical  for  most  public  education  providers,  we  have  a  limited  budget  for  infrastructure.  Catalyst  switching,  especially  the  2960-X,  allows  us  to  easily  manage  stacks  of  switches  in  each  closet  for  high  port  density,  with  the  capability  to  run  10Gbps  (or  higher  with  port  channels)  backbone  connections. 2960 Access Switches.  Catalyst  2960  X/XR  Series My experience with Webex Events.  My  use-case  is  like  we  have  monthly  town  hall  meetings,  and  participants  will  be  from  across  the  United  States.  So  we  use  Cisco  Webex  Events  to  organize  those  meetings,  and  it  precisely  serves  the  purpose  of  what  is  needed  for  us.  It  has  seamless  connectivity,  and  voice  clarity  is  excellent.  I  would  recommend  this  product  to  others. Webex Events - great for large meetings.  In  my  previous  role  at  a  larger  international  research  institute,  I  managed  Cisco  Webex  Events  for  global  and  national  program  meetings  to  share  updates  and  facilitate  internal  learnings.  Currently,  two  other  colleagues  have  log-in  credentials,  so  they  are  responsible  for  setting  up  Webex  Events  for  bi-weekly  program  meetings,  other  ad  hoc  events,  and  external  convenings  for  technical  groups. There are much better options in the webinar space!.  We  used  Cisco  Webex  Events  for  many  years  as  our  sole  webinar  provider.  When  we  started,  they  were  the  biggest  player  in  the  space  and  served  the  purpose  of  being  able  to  provide  a  pretty  reliable  service  to  host  online  trainings  and  events.  We  used  this  provider  within  our  entire  organization. WebEx Events Review.  I  am  an  Event  Specialist  working  for  Americas  Marketing  Organization.  We  currently  use  Web  Ex  events  for  webinars.  We  generate  several  webinars  per  year.  They  are  targetted  to  educate  our  customers  on  what  problems  our  equipment  can  solve  and  or  how  to  use  our  equipment. Webex Events gets the job done!.  Currently,  we  are  using  Cisco  Webex  Events  to  host  events  and  conference  calls. Webex has served as the perfect tool for my live online certification course!.  I  am  currently  in  an  online  certification  course  that  uses  Webex  as  their  media  for  facilitation.  I  am  currently  the  only  one  in  this  office  using  Webex. Fairly high-end web conferencing tool that doesn\\'t really justify its price point.  We  use  Webex  Events  throughout  our  nonprofit,  educational  organization  in  order  to  provide  virtual  instructor-led  webinars  to  our  clients,  both  internal  and  external.  It  addresses  the  problem  of  being  able  to  hold  synchronous,  digital  events  with  users  across  organizations  and  across  the  world.  We  can  present  content  to  a  large  number  of  people  and  share  recordings  with  them  afterwards. Good software, really bad customer service..  Our  organization  has  been  using  Webex  Event  Center  to  deliver  instructional  webinars  to  a  group  of  external  audience  for  more  a  year  now.  We  rely  on  audio  broadcasts  to  deliver  live  webinars  and  training  programs  to  music  teachers  across  North  America. WebEx May Be the Pioneer of Videoconference Technology.  Web  Ex  is  often  used  here  because  an  external  party  uses  that  platform.  We  would  join  a  Web  Ex  meeting,  usually  for  some  type  of  tutorial  or  training.  It  is  used  by  various  departments  here  and  provides  a  way  for  users  to  see  an  instructor  do  a  demo  that  involves  software  or  a  computer  usage. Tried and true and Reliable gathering tool.  Since  we  started  utilizing  the  Webex  at  work,  correspondence  is  substantially  more  fluid.  Groups  can  use  the  platform  for  document  sharing  and  screen  sharing,  which  enhances  our  work. A GREAT solution for virtual training sessions.  Web  Ex  Event  Center  is  used  across  my  organization  for  numerous  scenarios  ranging  from  internal  meetings  to  client  demos. \"It s\",  a  great  tool  to  provide  screen  sharing  and  conferencing  to  a  large  group  of  attendees.  It  solves  the  problem  of  meeting  and  demoing  solutions  across  numerous  locations. Cast a wider web and facilitate great events with WebEx Event Center.  My  organization  achieved  greater  scalability  in  terms  of  training  and  conference  offerings  through  Web  Ex  Event  Center.  We  first  used  Web  Ex  Event  Center  when  we  had  regulatory  changes  that  all  staff  needed  to  be  made  aware  of.  The  Event  Center  enabled  us  to  reach  all  staff  at  once,  despite  their  physical  locations.  Also,  the  events  hosted  were  not  just  unilateral,  since  Web  Ex  fosters  the  learning  experience  by  enabling  attendees  to  ask  questions.  The  increased  engagement  led  to  productive  meetings. Webex Events and how they drive business..  Web  Ex  is  used  by  many  of  my  peers  at  my  job.  We  mainly  use  it  to  hold  events  for  marketing  as  well  as  setting  up  internal  calls  for  all  hands  meetings.  The  best  experience  I  have  had  is  with  lead  generation  from  bigger  webinars  and  getting  future  prospects  for  our  cloud  platforms. Meet Me Halfway with WebEx Event Center.  Web  Ex  Even  Center  is  currently  being  used  across  our  entire  organization  and  is  part  of  our  Cisco  Unified  Communications  effort.  Web  Ex  Event  Center  addresses  our  need  for  an  online  meeting  platform  as  we  are  a  global  company  with  offices  in  several  companies.  Web  Ex  is  also  integrated  with  our  Jabber  chat  client  for  on-demand  meetings  and  our  LMS  for  virtual  training. Automate the world  (or at least the DC).  We  have  used  ACI  as  part  of  our  existing  platforms  and  also  deployed  it  as  part  of  various  Cisco  infrastructure  projects  for  clients.  In  addition  we  have  also  on  occasion  performed  consulting  functions  to  clients  that  either  had  tried  to  deploy  themselves  or  had  work  done  by  another  integrator  and  had  run  into  un  expected  complications. ACI as the foundation of the software define datacenter.  We  use  ACI  in  our  new  SDDC  (Software  Defined  Data  Center)  which  is  used  in  three  different  data  center  locations  in  Europe  to  be  able  to  deliver  a  hybrid  cloud  to  our  internal  customers  worldwide.  This  is  a  network  area  that  is  deployed  in  parallel  to  our  existing  legacy  network. Cisco ACI Review.  We  use  Cisco  ACI  as  a  multi-pod  version  across  four  data  centers.  Each  data  center  has  two  fire  protection  zones,  with  half  of  one  pod.  We  needed  layer  2  networking  across  Germany  on  these  four  different  locations.  We  consume  networks  on  Hyper  Flex  Clusters  and  some  other  Hardware  Servers.  Each  pod  has  two  spines  and  four-leaf  switches. Cisco ACI: Steep, but worthy learning curve. \"It s\",  mainly  used  in  our  Data  Centers,  together  with  our  Internet  Service  Provider  Partner  who  mainly  manages  our  network,  along  with  other  customers.Cisco  ACI  is  used  for  the  whole  organization,  and  mainly  by  the  IT  department.  It  helps  and  solves  SDN  issues  and  hindrances  which  eases  our  deployments  of  services.The  main  reason  for  doing  so,  as  from  the  technical  discussions,  was  mainly  for  stability  and  centralized  management,  along  with  the  new  security  features  that  it  offers. Is ACI good?.  It  is  used  as  a  platform  for  private  cloud  &  tenanted  &  connected  into  the  MPLS  cloud  per  customer.  We  used  it  for  customers  that  did  not  want  to  go  to  public  cloud  &  it  has  worked  out  cheaper  for  them  than  using  AWS  or  GCP  versions.  We  price  it  as  a  fixed  price  model  with  no  usage-based  costs. ACI review for Multi-Cloud.  I  have  implemented  if  for  a  large  airline  business. \"It s\",  being  used  for  the  whole  organisation  and  it  replaced  the  legacy  DC.  It  solved  the  biggest  issues  with  the  old  STP  and  loops  and  simplified  the  L2  domain  in  a  much  cleaner  way  without  understanding  the  underlying  technical  complexities. \"It s\",  a  great  solution  if  you \"don t\",  want  to  build  the  fabric  manually. Cisco ACI Review.  We  changed  our  old  Nexus  switches  in  two  data  centers  (stretched  L2  design)  to  a  Cisco  ACI  multi-pod  design  and \"it s\",  now  in  production.  Yes,  you  have  to  learn  a  lot  of  new  things  and \"it s\",  totally  different  from  what  it  was  before.  But \"it s\",  worth  it.  We  have  added  stability  (no  more  STP  in  the  fabric),  centralized  management  (upgrades  are  now  so  easy)  and  security \"(it s\",  much  more  easy  to  segment  the  data  center). ACI review.  We  have  just  started  to  deploy  this  in  non-prod  mode.  We  are  currently  doing  the  Po  C  and  trying  to  understand  various  ways  in  which  this  could  be  implemented  in  our  environment,  which  would  give  us  maximum  benefit.  And  also  we  need  to  ensure  that  this  has  minimum  disruption  to  the  business  operation  and  our  network  operations  team  also  gets  a  better  understanding  of  how  to  support  this  environment. Steep learning curve but Cisco ACI is really worth it.  I  help  other  companies  implement  Cisco  ACI  at  their  data  center.  From  design  to  implementation  and  support.  Mainly  Cisco  ACI  is  used  by  the  IT-department.  Cisco  ACI  solves/helps  solve  SDN  in  the  data  centers,  and  it  really  helps  with  faster  deployments  of  services  in  the  data  centers. Empower your DC with Cisco ACI.  Cisco  ACI  (Application  Centric  Infrastructure)  allowed  us  to  renew  our  datacenter  facilities  in  different  ways.  The  introduction  of  a  spine-leaf  architecture  allowed  to  optimize  cabling  and  improve  scalability  of  the  overall  datacenter.  The  Nexus  9k  improved  the  performance.  The  Cisco  ACI  Controller  introduced  our  company  to  a  programmable  infrastructure  that  is  cloud-ready. Cisco ACI.  We  use  Cisco  ACI  in  our  newest  production  environments.  Our  ACI  fabrics  are  used  for  multiple  users  in  three  different  countries  and  each  of  the  fabrics  are  currently  separate  installations  but  we  have  plans  to  install  a  multi-site  orchestrator  on  top  of  the  solutions  to  be  able  to  control  all  fabrics  from  one  centralized  location. See eye to eye with Cisco ACI.  We  use  Cisco  ACI  as  the  foundation  for  our  private  cloud  and  now  with  the  latest  innovation  stretching  that  into  the  public  cloud  with  ACI  and  Hyper  Flex  Anywhere. ACI APIC from a developer\\'s perspective.  The  ACI  APIC  is  used  for  programmatic  data  centre  automation.  The  key  business  problem  it  solves  is  integrating  network  provisioning  with  IT  service  deployment  in  an  automated,  end-to-end  service  provisioning  chain.  APIC  also  provides  visibility  of  the  \"health\"  status  of  applications  in  the  ACI  fabric,  which  is  key  to  maintaining  IT  SLAs. ACI revealed!.  It  is  being  used  across  the  whole  organization.  It  addresses  business  agility  and  flexibility.  We  are  showing  its  benefits  to  our  customers. Steep learning curve, but well worth the investment..  We  have  several  data  centers  running  a  mix  of  Fabric  Path,  Catalyst  and  ACI.  We  have  a  data  center  that  has  been  around  for  a  few  years \"that s\",  only  ACI  and  are  starting  to  roll  ACI  out  to  additional  data  centers  now  that \"we ve\",  solidified  the  design/architecture.  Our  engineers  have  struggled  a  bit  with  adopting  it  as  a  new  technology  since \"it s\",  such  a  different  mindset  than  traditional  networking,  but  several  of  us  have  embraced  the  new  mindset  and  the  potential  that  comes  along  with  it  and \"we ve\",  been  able  to  make  massive  changes  and  architectural  improvements  as  a  result. ACI review from a VAR.  I  am  with  a  VAR,  and  we  have  deployed  Cisco  Application  Centric  Infrastructure  (ACI)  a  few  times  for  customers.  Most  times  it  is  a  POC  or  POV,  but  sometimes  in  production.  Due  to  the  staggering  differences  between  ACI  and  traditional  Cisco  networking,  I  find  most  customers  prefer  a  phased  approach. The Application Centric Approach.  Cisco  ACI  is  used  for  both  internal  and  customer  centric  applications.  Internal  applications  are  used  by  a  variety  of  teams  within  the  organization.  ACI  is  easy  to  provision  and  maintain  and  requires  very  less  operational  tasks  on  a  daily  basis.  The  initial  configuration  and  design  requires  much  thought. Cisco Small Business Switches -- there is no competition.  We  use  Cisco  Small  Business  (SG)  switches  at  almost  all  of  our  client  sites.  They  provide  all  of  the  features  that  we  need  at  an  attractive  price  point,  plus  have  the  advantage  of \"Cisco s\",  support,  both  in  official  and  community-based  forms.  They  provide  basic  network  connectivity,  the  functionality  to  segregate  networks  for  different  tasks  (VLANs),  and  power  to  IP  phones  and  other  network  devices  (Power  over  Ethernet). Cisco switches in DC and campus.  Cisco  ethernet  switches  are  used  in  many  environments  in  our  data  centre  and  also  in  our  office  networks.  We  have  been  using  Cisco  Catalyst  and  Nexus  devices  for  many  years  and  they  are  enablers  for  all  data  communication  in  our  company  and  provide  us  the  possibility  to  focus  on  our  core  business. Cisco switches.  I  use  Cisco  switches  for  every  single  port  in  my  environment;  they  are  powerful,  stable,  and  always  have  predictable  behaviour. Cisco Industrial Switching.  Since  Cisco  entered  the  industrial  ruggedized  market  for  their  switching  products  I  have  had  used  1000s  of  the  IE3000,  4000,  5000s  and  they  are  great  products.  They  brought  the  Cisco  IOS  and  those  advanced  features  into  a  world  where  we  see  temperatures  of  up  to  50  degrees  Celsius  (ambient). Industry Standard for Enterprise Switching.  Cisco  Ethernet  Switches  are  the  industry  standard  for  enterprise  level  networks.  I  have  installed  and  helped  configure  the  6500  series  all  the  way  through  to  the \"3850 s\",  which  seem  to  be  the  most  widely  used  now.  I  was  totally  against  changing  from  the  \"blade\"  type  switches  to  the  stackable  switches  like  the  3750  and  3850,  but  now  I \"wouldn t\",  change  back  even  if  it  were  possible. Gold Standard Network Gear.  Cisco  networking  gear  is  the  gold  standard  in  the  industry.  We  had  a  number  of  Cisco  switches  in  production  when  I  took  over  responsibility  for  managing  them.  They  are  by  far  the  most  reliable  network  hardware  I’ve  ever  used.  Coming  from  smaller  shops  where  budgets  don’t  always  optimize  IT  equipment,  the  cheaper  hardware  just  doesn’t  compare  to  Cisco  switches. Cisco Switch Experience.  We  standardized  on  Cisco  in  order  to  achève  the  best  available  uptime  and  lost  support  overhead.  Cost  is  high,  and  you  need  to  ensure  that  you  have  sufficient  technical  knowledge  within  the  team  to  support  them,  but  their  performance  and  reliability  have  been  very  good.  We  were  lucky  to  have  a  very  good  Cisco  account  manager  who  supported  us  well  with  our  existing  equipment  and  future  purchasing  plans. Cisco ASR 1000 Routers.  ASR  1000  is  serving  as  WAN  aggregation  Router  for  termination  of  our  external  links.  Enabled  with  active  VRF  lite  BGP  routing  externally  and  internally. Cisco 1000 - Not the most cost effective solution.  We  were  using  it  firmwide  to  protect  our  network  hardware  from  intruders  as  well  as  malware  to  move  our  data  past  our  internal  WAN  perimeter.  We  have  very  heavy  traffic  and  were  searching  for  a  solution  to  help  us  manage  this  data  without  interruption  in  our  always-on  network. A wide range of devices in the family to suit a variety of network needs..  The  Cisco  ASR  1000  series  router  comes  in  multiple  formats,  each  tailored  to  some  specific  uses.  They  are  physically  different  in  size  and  how  much  space  they  take  up,  which  results  in  computing  power  differences  as  well  as  what  purpose  they  are  best  suited  for.  Given  that  information,  we  widely  use  the  ASR1002  and  ASR1006  within  our  network  and  organization.  Both  platforms  use  the  same  OS,  IOS-XE. Cisco ASR 1001 routers in a multi VRF enterprise-wide WAN.  We  use  the  ASR  routers  at  our  power  plant  locations  as  the  core  of  the  WAN  network  running  multiple  VRF  instances.  The  VRF  instances  provide  separation  of  corporate  and  plant  controls  traffic  running  over  our  private  10G  WAN  infrastructure. Cisco ASR 1000 router: a great choice for the enterprise.  We  use  ASR1000  series  in  our  testing  department  for  setting  up  new  visualization  tools  and  streaming  servers.  It  also  supports  the  redundant  Internet  links  developed  for  UAT  and  SIT  for  critical  configuration  testings.  The  availability  of  high  speed  Internet  is  a  critical  requirement  here  as  we  have  many  clients  who  use  cloud-based  big  data  clusters  and  Qliksense  for  checking  live  data.  The  wholesale  banking  products  as  well  the  real-time  macro-economic  data  is  fed  from  Oxford  economics  to  run  various  Monte  Carlo  simulations,  so  availability  of  high  speed  and  minimal  downtime  is  vital. ASughhhhhhhhhR review.  We  are  using  Cisco  ASR  1K  for  both  internet  edge  and  Multiprotocol  Label  Switching  (MPLS)  provider  aggregation  services. Amazing and great choice for the enterprise Environments.  Especially  we  have  chosen  it  because  it  has  good  Reliability,  security,  and  especially  much  better  performance  than  we  had  using  other  routers  in  our  region. The Cisco ASR 1002 answers our prayers.  We  use  the  ASR1002  as  our  core  aggregation  router  tying  together  our  entire  WAN.  The  WAN  consists  of  3  MPLS  carriers,  several  edges,  firewalled  services,  a  couple  of  P2P  sites,  and  a  MOE. broad use of Cisco routers globally.  Build  VPN-tunnels  between  customers  and  our  data  centers  or  integrate  external  supporters  in  the  data  centers  Layer3  networks  as  gateway  and  converter  between  protocols.  If  the  carrier  is  providing  a  Layer-2  Etherlink,  we  terminate  on  both  sides  at  a  Layer-3  device,  which  is  the  router  Terminate  Layer-2  boundaries  at  a  defined  hardware  to  end  problems  from  customers. Cisco ISR Router review.  ISR  routers  are  used  as  intra-area  edge  routers  for  our  3  major  campuses  as  well  as  our  HA  edge  routers  to  the  internet. Cisco Routers.  We  use  the  ISR  for  our  branches  and  the  ASR  in  our  data  centers.  We  have  more  than  50  branches  and  12  data  centers  around  the  world.  We  have  2x  MPLS  networks  connecting  our  branches  and  data  centers  and  we  are  using  BGP  to  dynamic  routing  all  our  traffic.  We  also  use  ASR  to  receive  circuits  from  our  clients  in  a  BPN  environment. ASR1000, For the Win.  We  use  the  ASR1000  series  for  our  Internet  edge.  We  run  with  a  full  BGP  feed  with  redundant  routers  and  redundant  Internet  links.  They  provide  us  with  highly  available  Internet  access.  This  is  a  critical  service  for  us  because  many  of  our  core  services  are  cloud-based.  General  access  to  the  Internet  is  also  a  core  service  we  provide.  Even  a  short  outage  can  generate  a  lot  of  trouble  tickets  and  complaints. A skeptic but agreeable opinion..  We  use  cisco  routers  for  both  edge,  core  and  application  service  routing  and  tunnelling.  I  also  use  a  Cisco  router  at  home.  The  routers  in  play  have  to  be  reliable  and  performant  above  all  else  and  the  HA  feature  set  needs  to  be  both  simple  and  reliable. Cisco Meraki Review.  We  use  Cisco  Meraki  across  the  whole  organization.  We  manage  our  wireless  network  with  it.  We  have  separated  our  wireless  network  for  different  purposes  and  we  can  manage  them  more  efficiently  with  this  device.  We  have  a  splash  page  for  the  guest  that  comes  to  our  organization, \"that s\",  really  helpful. Cisco Meraki MR3: Well Versed and Cost Effective Wireless Solutions.  We  deployed  it  across  the  whole  organization.  Most  visible  in  our  guest  areas,  conference  and  huddle  rooms. Great product for remote sites.  Cisco  Meraki  MR20  is  being  used  in  one  of  our  branches,  as  we  think  it  is  the  easiest  way  to  manage  a  far  away  branch  network.  It  helps  us  to  manage  the  network  remotely  without  an  existing  network  engineer  on  site.  At  the  same  time,  it  gives  users  the  ability  to  connect  wirelessly  to  our  network. Meraki MR feedback. \"We re\",  deploying  this  kind  of  model  for  some  of  our  customers.  We  have  deployed  devices  into  our  headquarters  and  stores  to  configure  SD  Wan  with  2  internet  lines. Cisco Meraki MR33 Review.  Yes,  we  are  using  Cisco  Meraki  in  our  whole  organization.  And  I  am  very  satisfied  with  this  product  in  terms  of  wireless  technology.This  solution  helps  us  to  increase  productivity  and  now  the  user  faces  fewer  issues  because  we  manage  this  solution  remotely.  It \"doesn t\",  matter  where  I  am. Cisco Meraki MR33 Review.  We  use  it  to  give  wireless  access  within  our  building.  We  have  6  of  them  deployed  and  they  give  excellent  service  to  all  our  employees.  We  have  a  guest  as  well  as  a  network  access  setup.  Visitors  are  able  to  easily  connect  to  the  wireless  without  any  issues.  Employees  use  it  with  their  laptops  and  cell  phones. Meraki MR - Wireless Simplified.  Meraki  MR  APs  are  my \"organization s\",  primary  solution  for  providing  wireless  to  our  various  office  and  sites.  Because  all  configurations  are  done  in  the  cloud,  there  is  no  need  for  the  locations  to  require  a  VPN  tunnel  back  to  the  CORP  office  for  the  APs  to  work.  This  allows  us  to  deploy  our  wireless  network  almost  any  where  as  long  as  there  is  internet  connectivity. Cisco Meraki MR Series - Great for schools.  We  are  a  school  district  with  about  6,600  students  in  9  buildings  and  various  other  buildings.  We  have  almost  600  Meraki  APs  throughout  the  district.  The  Cisco  Meraki  MR  Series  is  easy  to  manage  and  has  performed  well  for  us  overall.  We  are  a  1:1  district,  so  almost  all  of  the  6,600  students  have  devices  that  access  the  internet  over  wireless,  so  having  good  wireless  is  critical. Revolutionary LAN  with Cisco Meraki Switches.  We  are  using  MR  in  our  corporate  and  branch  offices  to  centralize  the  administration  and  visibility  of  network  and  users  behavior.  Also,  we  have  hospitality  clients  who  have  chosen  MR  in  each  guest  room  to  minimize  the  cabling  inside  rooms  while  still  delivering  all  the  services  they  need:  Wi  Fi,  wired  connectivity,  IP  Telephony,  IP  TV  and  security  system  (panic  bottom,  geofence,  etc) Meraki MR Wireless.  We  use  Cisco  Meraki  MR  Series  access  points  across  our  school  district  for  all  wireless  access.  It  gives  us  end  to  end  wireless  connectivity  for  all  our  district  needs. Meraki MR - The mister in APs.  We  have  implemented  the  MR42  APs  in  our  main  office.  The  solution  has  provided  exactly  what  we  needed  for  our  company.  We  were  able  to  implement  end  user  authentication  via  Radius,  and  have  control  of  access  for  guest  users. Easy to manage from anywhere.  The  Cisco  Meraki  MR  Series  are  used  in  my  organization  to  give  wifi  access  to  the  employees  and  the  company  guests.  The  connection  is  very  good,  simple  and  quick.  We  have  many  ways  to  authenticate  the  user  for  each  kind  of  profile  we  need.  The  administration  is  very  easy  and  simple,  and  we  can  make  any  change  from  any  place  with  internet  access. Small and fancy but powerful.  This  AP  gave  us  the  possibility  to  setup  wireless  networks  in  small  offices  where  having  physical  cabling  might  not  be  the  best  option.  This  AP  can  provide  you  a  lot  of  fancy  network  features  that  may  increase  UX  -  MIMO,  802.11ac,  self  provisioning,  etc.  Also \"it s\",  good  from  a  security  point  of  view  as  it  integrates  with  802.1x  and  ISE.In  general  I  like  the  product  and  I  think \"it s\",  worth  the  money. Best Network Solution for Business.  It  is  been  used  for  conference  rooms  only.  We  expected  to  have  high  performance  on  our  Wi  Fi  Access  Point  during  pic  loads.  Usually  it  is  really  helpful  in  meetings  when  we  need  to  supply  internet  for  20+  users/guests  with  mobile  devices.  We  also  have  a  few  more  MR  devices  in  our  offices.  So  far  so  good  with  performance  and  uptime. Catalyst 9200 - Best choice on the market!.  Catalyst  9200  Series If you need a better tomorrow, use Cisco Catalyst 9200 Series Switches.

Catalyst  2960  X/XR  Series  Catalyst  3650  Series Cisco Catalyst from a SysAdmin perspective.  Cisco  Catalyst  is  used  across  the  organization.  It  is  used  to  connect  buildings  in  different  countries.  Cisco  Catalyst  products  are  very  reliable  and  they  can  work  for  years  with  no  downtime.  The  company  recently  refreshed  the  old  switches  and  routers  that  worked  for  years,  but  they  never  failed  any  single  time.  These  products  can  be  configured  in  so  many  different  ways  according  to  the  business  necessities  and  they  provide  very  strong  security  protection  to  the  valuable  infrastructure. Reliable and Familiar.  The  ASR  9000  is  used  as  our  core  routing  solution.  Here  it  works  as  a  BRASS,  Building  L2vpn,  L3vpn  for  customers  also  as  a  border  gateway  router.  All  our  services  our  connected  to  the  ASR  9000  as  our  mobile  platform  for  our  corporate  LAN  and  VOIP  services.  We  also  have  directly  connected  distribution  switches. Promising platform with show-stopping bugs.  We  are  using  it  for  core  and  peering  routers  due  to  the  insane  FIB  storage  available  compared  to  the  Nexus  7Ks  they  replaced.  We  were  not  using  any  platform-specific  features  so  when  hardware  refresh  time  came  up  and  the  options  were  N7700  or  A9900  it  seemed  to  be  a  no-brainer  based  on  the  capability  in  terms  of  both  hardware  and  software  and  side-by-side  cost  comparison.  Is  a  9900  overkill  for  a  standard  IP  core?  Definitely,  but  we  were  looking  to  maintain  a  full  table  and  not  have  to  worry  about  FIB  limitations. ASR 9000 -  Excellent product!!.  In  our  company,  the  ASR  9000  Routers  are  used  as  core  routers  in  the  network. Great tools for running router delay simulators!.  We  use  this  to  carry  out  our  core  of  services.  We  use  them  for  data  transfers,  Vo  IP,  and  video  communication. Cisco ASR9000 series is a one size fits most type of device for large Service Providers..  It  is  basically  used  as  a  fully  functional  core  router  on  the  network.  It  has  the  capability  to  handle  the  amount  of  traffic  going  through  it  and  is  easily  expandable  as  demand  grows.  In  addition,  due  to  its  versatility,  it  is  also  being  considered  as  a  potential  edge  router  for  future  expansion. ASR 9000 is great but wish it had more 100 gig ports.  The  ASR  9000  is  being  used  as  a  1  gig  and  10  gig  aggregation.  It  supports  Layer  2  and  Layer  3  as  well  as  some  complex  MPLS  applications  that  we  require.  It  also  does  a  great  job  with  multicast  routing. Cisco ASR in DC.  We  use  Cisco  Routers  within  our  DC  as  well  as  between  different  DCs.  They  are  used  as  core  routers  for  inside  services  and  WAN  routers  on  our  MPLS  and  towards  third-party  WAN  routers.  We  have  installed  those  to  multiple  different  production  networks  and  most  of  the  routers  are  used  by  multiple  customers. High performance, high reliability (but high cost too!).  Our  organization  uses  both  ISR  models  and  ASR  9000  series  models  of  Cisco  routers  to  manage  traffic  across  endpoints.  These  allow  our  network  to  be  configured  with  an  active-passive  failsafe  (primary/secondary)  to  support  our  high  performance  and  high  availability  needs  across  various  components  of  our  business-critical  infrastructure.  The  ASR  series  routers  are  also  used  in  our  global  data  centers. Cisco Routing!.  We  use  Cisco  Routers  within  our  department  for  a  service  provider  core  network.  Using  primarily  the  Cisco  ASR  9K  series,  we  are  able  to  provide  solutions  for  whatever  our  partner  companies  needs  are. ASR routers.  We  are  using  the  ASR  routers  to  build  our  multi-state  10G  ringed  wide  area  network  using  our  own  fiber  network. Quality products.  This  was  used  primarily  for  internal  routing,  in  support  of  up  to  500  users. My experience with Cisco Catalyst 2960-L.

Cisco  Access  Point Great collaboration device / second monitor for either work-from-home or in the office..  With  the  COVID-19  restrictions  we  suddenly  needed  a  way  to  easily  meet  and  collaborate  from  home.  We  were  already  using  Cisco  Teams  so  we  decided  to  buy  some  DX80s  to  facilitate  our  staff  working  from  home  and  enable  them  to  participate  in  meeting  and  planning  sessions  with  a  great  screen  which  also  doubles  as  a  2nd  display. Cisco Webex DX80 is a dynamite device!.  The  DX80  is  currently  being  used  by  a  couple  of  users  in  remote  work  scenarios  resulting  from  the  pandemic  that  we  are  currently  facing.  The  unit  allows  for  ease-of-use  when  participating  in  conferencing  calls  as  well  as  collaboration  with  other  team  members.  The  DX  80  allows  for  whiteboarding  and  other  tools  that  are  used  amongst  the  team.  The  entire  system  makes  it  very  easy  to  use  for  any  user. Personal Desk VC Equipment.  In  my  job  as  a  Concierge  Engineer,  I  support  our  customers  by  assisting  them  in  setting  up  their  Video  Conference  Meetings  through  our  Concierge  Service.  I  use  Cisco  Desk  Endpoints  (in  my  case,  Cisco  Webex  DX80)  as  my  personal  unit,  which  I  use  to  dial  into  the  conference  that  I  am  setting  up  and  assisting  our  Video  Collaboration  Customers  with,  to  ensure  that  their  meetings  start  without  issues  -  such  as  Audio,  Video  and  Presentation  concerns. The real workhorse behind the personal meeting experience that is Webex Meetings..  This  device  is  being  placed  in  VP  and  above  offices  and  now  during  COVID  in  their  homes  as  well.  We  are  also  deploying  these  in  to  the  homes  of  Webex  \"Power\"  users  within  our  organization  to  keep  the  momentum  going  on  Webex  meetings  adoption.  This  device  is  all  over  our  org  but  only  in  a  limited  supply  or  about  100  or  so  throughout  the  entire  company. My Cisco Webex DX80 review.  DX80s  are  used  for  telehealth  meetings  as  well  as  administration.  With  the  increased  need  for  social  distance,  these  have  provided  alternatives  to  in-person  meetings. How my Cisco Webex DX80 has made me more productive.  The  Cisco  Webex  DX80  is  being  used  as  a  diagnostic  tool  that  assists  with  troubleshooting  VTC  sessions. The perfect device for collaborating during a pandemic..  It  is  used  primarily  by  senior  executives  and  the  devices  have  been  made  more  essential  during  the  pandemic  with  everyone  working  remotely. Cisco Webex DX80 Review.  Our  Cisco  Webex  DX80s  are  used  as  a  preferred  desktop  solution  for  our  Major  Command  leadership  and  directorates  on  both  secure  and  un-secure  Do  D  networks.  The  DX80  provides  versatility  in  video  conferencing/communications  that  laptops  w/cameras  could  not  address.  The  DX80  allows  commanders/directors  the  ease  of  full  conferencing  capabilities  while  remaining  at  their  desks/offices/homes. Cisco Webex DX80 Review.  It  is  primarily  used  for  Cisco  Webex  Video  conferencing  and  is  used  by  mid-level  to  senior  executives.  Executives/Mid-level  managers  across  Sales,  Support,  and  Consulting  use  it  today.  The  main  problem  it  addresses  is  the  ability  to  have  high-quality  video  during  conferences  especially  during  COVID  when  the  workforce  has  become  largely  distributed  and  we  no  longer  work  out  of  office  even  for  our  own  internal  meetings,  let  alone  customer  meetings. Cisco Webex DX80 delivers a quality experience in a simple unit.  We  use  the  DX80  in  a  few  different  ways.  In  our  small  1-2  user  huddle  spaces,  it  acts  as  a  standalone  video  conferencing  and  audio  conferencing  device.  As  a  quiet  room  device,  it  acts  the  same  as  the  above  and  allows  for  users  to  connect  to  their  individual  laptops  as  a  kind  of  hoteling  device  along  with  being  a  quality  video  unit.  And  we  also  use  them  for  executive  and  power  remote  user  devices  to  ensure  a  secure  quality  video  experience. Cisco Webex DX80: A Great Choice.  We  use  the  DX80  system-wide  in  our  health  system  as  an  option  for  a  desktop  or  very  small  conference  room  setting.  The  addition  of  Webex  being  our  main  source  of  meeting  collaboration  has  made  the  DX80  a  perfect  option  to  simplify  joining  meetings. The perfect personal device to extend your computer for meetings..  Cisco  Webex  DX80  is  used  as  a  personal  device  for  Webex  Meetings  and  internal  meetings.  We  can  use  it  as  a  second  screen  and  it  can  replace  the  speaker  of  the  computer.  The  screen  is  pretty  big  with  1080p  resolution  and  HDMI  connection.  The  camera  can  flip  automatically  if  we  need  to  switch  it  to  view  a  paper  on  the  desk. Catalyst 9400: a good campus core switch.  Catalyst  9400  Series Sharpshooter switches!.

RSTP,  IGMP,  BGP,  PIM,  MVR  -  you  name  it, \"we ve\",  already  done  it  on  our  Catalyst!  Will  continue  to  recommend  to  small  and  medium  businesses. Win win for everyone.  Cisco  ISR  1000  is  addressing  our  high  bandwidth  VPN  connection  with  remote  sites.  We  connect  with  our  other  partners  using  this  platform.  Cisco  ISR  1000  is  being  used  by  all  of  our  organization  at  different  branches  and  headquarters.  We  are  using  the  same  routers  as  MPLS  and  BGP  RR  to  differentiate  between  different  departments.  Router  is  modular,  very  reliable  with  Cisco  family  of  support.  We  totally  love  Cisco  ISR  1000. Cisco Routers - Battle and time tested equipment.  We  currently  utilize  Cisco  routers  as  our  primary  routing  platform  across  all  of  our  locations.  We  depend  highly  on  connectivity  between  our  sites  and  the  Cisco  platforms  we  utilize  help  us  achieve  maximum  performance  and  reachability. Cisco Routers great Performance and Reliability.  We  use  Cisco  Routers  in  all  our  offices.  The  routers  service  all  our  network  traffic  for  all  employees.  The  routers  sit  in  front  of  the  Firewall  in  the  DMZ.  We  use  the  routers  for  our  Voice  services  and  we  also  use  them  for  our  MPLS  Data  services.  We  found  that  the  Cisco  routers  handle  Voice  traffic  very  well.  We  setup  Quality  of  Service  on  each  of  the  routers  to  prioritize  network  traffic  to  ensure  we  experience  the  highest  call  quality  to  ensure  our  Voice  traffic  takes  priority  over  all  the  other  network  traffic.  We  also  have  Cisco  routers  processing  our  MPLS  Data  for  our  inter  office  connectivity  for  both  voice,  data  and  printing  needed. I\\'m not good at catchy word play (That\\'s why I\\'m not in Marketing. ).  We  use  Cisco  Routers  and  switches  to  backbone  [and]  provide  network  support  for  a  training  environment  of  over  50  classrooms.  Then  in  the  hands-on  labs,  we  use  multiple  Cisco  Routers  and  switches  to  train  the  students  in  the  use  of  that  equipment  specific  to  the  needs  of  the  unit  they  operate. Bears love Cisco!.  We  use  ISR  routers  at  every  store.  We  use  ASRs  at  or  corporate  locations.  All  traffic  from  stores  is  required  to  go  to  corporate.  We  place  filters  on  the  routers  to  block  traffic  between  stores.  The  routers  have  a  primary  and  a  secondary  connection  and  switch  automatically  where  there  are  too  many  failures  on  the  main  connection. Routers!.  They  are  used  for  our  perimeter  devices. Cisco Routers.  We  are  using  Cisco  Routers  to  connect  remote  locations Cisco Routers - they just work..  They  are  the  standard.  We  use  Cisco  routers  in  all  locations,  from  our  Data  Centers  to  the  smallest  location  with  just  a  handful  of  users.  They  are  used  on  the  edge  and  in  the  core;  they  have  a  solution  for  all  our  needs. Cisco Users\\' Opinion.  Cisco  Routers  provide  us  with  reliable  connectivity  between  or  MSOs  and  cell  sites.  While  there  are  other  equipment  providers  who  work  in  the  same  space,  using  Cisco  routers  allows  us  to  leverage  industry  standard  tools  and  a  wide  range  of  pre-trained  engineers. Cisco Routers Have Served Me Well. \"They re\",  used  across  the  entire  organization  for  Vo  IP  purposes.  The  entire  company  has  made  the  shift  from  POTS  thanks  to  Cisco  routers.
