Worst bike dominar 400,Chain sound is very loud after riding 1500km i lube the chain with the lubricant  and i have also a yamaha r15 v3 i don't have faced any problem in my v3 like chain noise.  it's only bajaj and lots of vibrations in my dominar worst bike ever in 1.80lakh   go for ktm 390 .  Pay extra 90 thousand and much more better than this worst machine dominar.,1,neg,bikewale,25-03-2019
The fashionable-- bajaj dominar,"<p>Hi, this bajaj dominar is very good. It has great experience to ride. It is nice and comfortable to ride. Great to buy and as far as looks is concern it is very glamorous and shiny. Its servicing and maintenance is also good and handy at places. So overall it is good to buy this bike.And maintenance is also awesome. So ride well and safely and protect your life with helmet and follow traffic rules.</p>",3,neg,bikewale,25-04-2018
Not as shown in advertisement,"I have test driven it,it is not like shown in add where they troll royal enfield"" this bike is not good performer.Weight less body very hard transmission.Royal enfield is much much better that this one.They are using enfield legacy to sale there vehicle.After all bajaj has problem with silencer getting holes after sometime of use.No stability,not suitable for person with height.Handle are very congested.",1,neg,bikewale,25-04-2018
Don't buy dominar 400 or bajaj bikes,Bajaj's quality is so bad as compared to other bikes. Bajaj don't have proper engineers team. Service centres are terrible. I ride lots of bikes and i found brakes are not good.. Even dual channel abs is scrap if it doesn't work well. Service partner doesn't even know how to service bike. Chain set is very bad. Body quality is very bad. Every 4 5 days u have to tight the chain and but bolt in bike. Specially handle lock start shacking. Lots of noises coming from only the body of bike. And service centres are not able to solve your problems. They will take your bike for 1-2 week. Then give your bike without doing anything.Bike average is so poor. Lots unnecessary sounds.. Which makes irritate the owner of bike. Guys don't buy this bike.. U will get irritate from service partners.. Every week u have to visit service centres.And bajaj will not do anything on your complaints.,1,neg,bikewale,25-12-2018
Servicing and maintenance,"I have dominar bike, this is 1 year old bike running km is 14000 but both tyre is were out specialty front tyre . I put a complaint for resolve this concern . I am very satisfied with the product but why this problem is coming on only 14000 km if 40000 km running the bike then i understand and unresolved.",1,neg,bikewale,25-11-2018
Worst engineered bike of the year 2017 - dominar,"<p>1. Buying experience is average, the dealers are usually cheaters and do lot of golmals and gimmicks, one has to her very careful. At times they try to sell their test drive bikes</p><p>2. It doesn't feel like 400 cc bike, i owned apache 160 the performance and pickup is far superior when compared to domineer</p><p>3. It looks like a big bike but doesn't translate into performance of the bike. It is very poorly designed bike and need to visit the show room twice a week. Not reliable at all for longer run. If you want hassle free life, better avoid this.</p><p>4. Servicing is very poor, none of the service center guys know how to repair and maintain </p><p>    maintenance is very very poor, chain sprocket and chain needs frequent replacement</p><p>5. Pros: only the looks </p><p>Cons: </p><p>Fuel injection is always a problem</p><p>Mileage is always a problem</p><p>City riding, with the amount of generated heat, you can cook food and have tandoori</p>",1,neg,bikewale,25-04-2018
Chain sounds and 13kmpl mileage,This bike has great power. It takes us to heaven . But it provides least comfort since it's a Bajaj bike. like all other bikes of Bajaj it also has chain problem.There are disturbing noise from the chain.Even on smooth ride it offers less mileage. I get a mileage of 13 kmpl . Only positive side is speed which all other bike offer at this price.  It's better to have a KTM than bajaj. It has the best performance.,1,neg,bikewale,25-07-2018
super performance but it don't catch any eyeballs on road ,"buying experience was overall a good one.....and riding it was technically good.....400cc, abs,all led headlamp set up.....but the main problem is it don't catch any eyes on road....as do the royal enfield or the KTM's.....moreover it sounds like a 125 cc bike.....bajaj could have taken the design also from ktm.....going to sell it this one and upgrade to DUKE 250 or Thunderbird 500X.....",3,neg,bikewale,25-04-2018
Nothing can beat re,<p>I bought this bike a month ago ! at first everything was okay better riding experience was completely satisfied because i was in a state of confusion weather to buy re or dominar as dominar was new i just opted dominar i was completely happy that dominar didn't bought my image down in front my re friends but later i had a long trip with my friends and i felt the ride is bore and so uncomfortable your back will start paining after a ride around approx 30-45 km at one stretch you feel very very uncomfortable and feel difficult for further other things are okay with brakes and all those stuff . Maintenance is also fine not much headache. Whatever nothing can beat re !! i have done a mistake i should have opted re ! </p>,1,neg,bikewale,25-04-2018
Do not buy bajaj dominor,"I bought a new bajaj dominar 2 months before. While i was driving, the tire blasted and the alloy wheel also got damaged.  The quality is pathetic.Apart from that when i contacted bajaj showroom(popular bajaj showroom mandya and mysore), the service and response was very bad. The funny thing is they are asking me to claim insurance. Instead of helping me, they are neglecting me.I would suggest all of you to do not buy any bajaj bikes.All of you can understand that if within 2 months the tire can blast, think what what will be the condition after 2 years.",1,neg,bikewale,25-10-2018
Not to buy,"I don't want to write review here but i can suggest not to buy this bike, there are so many good bikes than this with less cost.No trained service centres, poor mileage, with hell of issues.I wouldn't recommend this shit bike to no one as it has lot of issues vibrant vibes, low quality of system were  more switches out of its original place also the engine itself is shit, a typical engine disturbance you will face as soon as you switch on the bike, rpm is not in constant as it varies every-time which is dangerous while riding, gear box and gear levers tend to get stuck and is really hard.",1,neg,bikewale,25-05-2018
Bajaj dominar 400 | idiocracy at its best by the beast,"Being a avid traveler and a rider what would you like to have? particularity a good bike with a decent mileage which can take you off roads, to the terrains and places without any hiccups.Talking about hiccups. Here comes the deal breaker the bike bajaj dominar 400 no doubt the cheapest 400cc till date in India and is the worst. Someone said particularly bajaj bikes are not trustworthy i didn't agree to the statement but after my buying experience and riding experience i had a different vision to look after my bike. Now i hate the statement dominate the road because even to dominate the road this bike consumers a hell lot of fuel and gives an average / mileage of 20kmpl which is worst than i can imagine and can accept it coming from the duke 390 but dominar 400 a big no. I wouldn't recommend this shit bike to no one as it has lot of issues including vibrant vibes, low quality plastics, abs and braking issues were brakes when applied more switches out of its original place, low quality tire hugger, also the engine itself is shit which you can notice after 6months of riding a typical engine disturbance you will face as soon as you switch on the bike, rpm is not in constant as it varies everytime which is dangerous while riding, gear box and gear levers tend to get stuck and is really hard.I do not want to complain but this what my experience with the bike i had. Also now coming to the later part of after sales. My service has been done from kanchan bajaj - wagle estate. Not to complain again but the engineers were of no use after i serviced my bike and when i was called to the service center to collect my bike i had to tell them again about the issues that i am facing including the vibrations of the bike then they tried to fixed it but couldn't and the brakes were no more the same as i had to struggle with the braking as well so even that was not being fixed.The answer is a big no if someone is looking for a hyperride like bajaj dominar 400. I would definitely recommend to not go for online reviews instead check with fellow riders or friends who owns bajaj dominar 400 try it out by yourself, test every bit of it and then own any bike that you wish for.",1,neg,bikewale,25-05-2018
If you thinking about to buy dominar the see my review,<p> The name bajaj tell you everything. the engine is not durable and if we talk about the 35 hp and 35 nm then we also see the weight which is around 180kg so power to weight ration is less and we all know that Indian companies use low grade material so i never like bajaj </p><p>And paint and sticker were also of cheap quality the logo of dominar (chrome) is rub very easily</p>,2,neg,bikewale,25-04-2018
The worst bike in the world,<p>Terrible bike.</p><p>All dominars are having engine issue from the first day. </p><p>Facing the same as i am also having bajaj dominar 400 abs</p><p>very harsh behaviour of bajaj showrooms and workshops officers.</p><p>Unprofessional staffs.</p><p>It's better to buy a 3rd hand bike than to purchase a first hand bajaj dominar 400 abs.</p>,1,neg,bikewale,25-04-2018
Turning Radius is disappointing. Also Avenger Cruise disappointing too.,"Had taken a test ride. Turning radius was too bad. Worst than my existing 2008 Avenger. Got a very short test ride from the showroom. Had tried this option as am looking for a new bike for change and upgrading my existing 10 yrs old bike. Also had got test ride for Avenger Cruiser, it was okay. Disappointed with no ABS or No Radial or Tubeless tyres with cruise model. Bajaj needs to rethink for their lineup with the existing models. Cruise with No ABS/Tubeless disappointing. Dominar with less and discomfort with Turning radius.",2,neg,bikewale,25-09-2018
"I feel bad, Buying one","i was having Bajaj 150, 180, 220cc it was good in ride and quality of materials used so i purchased one was a big mistake... wear and tear is more.. also showroom treat bajaj customer very badly... Thought of buying Ninja 300.. But purchased this was a big mistake.
Bajaj has to get work hardly to satisfy Sports bike customers not by showing stunt Advertisements.. But giving Refined and tension free engine.",1,neg,bikewale,25-10-2018
Just muscles are not enough.,"<p>Others have already explained good features. Let me explain the problems that i face.</p><p>One jump in dirty water entire space between tyre and seat gets dirty. Very bad designed mudguard.</p><p>When parked on weak land, it fell on left side, left safety bar got bent, gear clutch got damaged. Once fell on right side, break pedal got bent and right safety bar (size of a plm) got bent by 45 degrees, such a weak, cheap parts! i heard we can get safety bars for 750rs each! compare that shoulder wide steel safety bar of enfield.</p><p>They have designed it for long rides, forget large baggage there is not even place to keep a carry bag. Also it is just impossible to fit a side box. There is zero space below back seat, though it has a key to open!</p><p>Two times my son was almost falling sitting backside, don't know how designers don't have sense that, such a powered bike should have at-least an inch of backrest. Else they should not provide back seat.</p>",3,neg,bikewale,25-04-2018
Instead of buying dominar 400 buy ktm 250..... ,<p>The worse bike i have ever purchased & the worse things is that the bike gets vibrate a lot... Bajaj should work on this because if your buying a 400cc bike n its gets vibrate so it feels like your riding a 150cc bike...So i request u all to think n invest your money in dominar 400..Don't think about money think about the quality.</p>,2,neg,bikewale,25-04-2018
Good with problem,"I purchased a dominar on 14th feb 2018 and ridden about 700 km ,whenever i put my bike on 5th or 6th gear in traffic ,it will ride automatically without any acceleration and accelerator takes time to come to low and i am having heating problem also ,feel a burning sensation after keeping switching off its engine for 3-4 hrs. And rest it's all good.",3,neg,bikewale,25-09-2018
Good ride!,<p>Amazing bike well maintained... Good handling... I like this bike... More over its very fascinating... My friends love my bike very much... Pretty good mileage and maintenance is not much costly... Amazing bike handling is very good and smooth... With marvellous ride... Should try this bike at-least once.</p>,3,neg,bikewale,25-04-2018
Dominar pros and cons,"<p>1.

Suspension bad, back seat bad,length of the bike is too short for heighted person looks ok ok not good,</p><p>forget about mileage, tyres slippery</p>",3,neg,bikewale,25-04-2018
Satisfied,Not bad it is really comfortable for touring.Mileage of this bike is not bad. Comfort of this bike is also satisfied me. It will also perform like a bull when you cruising on corner. Top speed also better than rc 390.At this price range this is the best bike in my opinion. You should buy this bike if you are a lover of touring.....,3,neg,bikewale,25-06-2018
Awesome Design,Bajaj Dominar 400 is very strong machine but only this bike mistake means very vibration engine not comfort only this point negative and this price tag very low and many feature and mileage better. This bike look is very sexy bajaj dominar performance better than other this price tag and bajaj servicing is good.,3,neg,bikewale,25-02-2019
dominar 400 the bike you can buy,"<p>Buying experience- its. Nice 400 cc bike available in market with good price tag.</p><p>Riding experience-riding experience in dominar 400 is not bad..But not too good..I feel the abs is not so active and suspension could have been better and more improved</p><p>Details about the performance and looks-performance its good..But duke 390 is better </p><p>Looks of dominar 400 is great but it could have been better if bajaj company could have given the engine temperature meter which is available in classic royal enfield and dukes</p><p>Servicing and maintenance- as it is bajaj its servicing and maintenance is much easier than dukes and i am quiet satisfied about its maintenance cost.</p><p>Pros and cons-engine temperature meter is missing,break is not so active as in dukes,</p><p>Its has good looks and strong body...Best bike under good price range and i feel its its value for money bike.</p>",3,neg,bikewale,25-04-2018
Feel with performance ,"<p>Dominor 400 is monster bike ,when you ride this is like you dominate other with this bike , you feel like strong ,fast, so comfort , its fuel consumption is high but you know 400 cc bike ,so that we say over all packet of hunk .So don't think when you love bike riding , just go and buy this and go for long ride and make your own journey </p>",3,neg,bikewale,25-04-2018
Decent bike.. Could have been much better!!,"Buying experience was not good. I was told that after booking, i would get my bike in 10 days.. It almost took a month for my bike to arrive... Plus they tried to sell me a bike which was lying around in their showroom from the day i booked my bike.. So why the wait? On the highways, i find this bike powerful as well as comfortable.. No complaints.. But in the city traffic, this bike is no fun.. Too much engine braking results in frequent down shifting.. Once you release the throttle, there is a huge drag which forces you to down shift.. The bike just doesn't roll.. I haven't faced heating issues though.. Although the vibrations once you cross 4k rpm are very annoying.. Actually more than the vibrations, its the noise caused by vibrations which annoys me more.. Also i am facing power lag issues.. Don't know if it's the ecu or fi problem.. The service centre can't find the resolution.. Hence actually they say there is no issue with the bike.. They don't even have the guts to say that they don't have a solution to it.. Pissed off with them..Looks are awesome.. No doubt about that.. One of the major reasons why i bought the bike.. The other points in the bike's favour are price point and abs.. I haven't faced any major expenses on maintenance for my bike till now.. Just regular servicing costs around 1500 as paid servicing is yet to start.. I am getting a mileage of around 26-27 in city.. To summarise, i am not happy with the bike and wouldn't recommend the bike to anyone.. Pros: 1. Stunning looks 2. Good performance on the highways 3. Good pricing Cons:1. Too much engine braking.. Driving in the city traffic is a pain 2. Lot of vibrations near the tank after 4k rpm 3. Power lag issues.",3,neg,bikewale,25-04-2018
Honest review dominor 400,"<p>Bike look good , but many quality issues started after few kms crossed, e.G. With in 2000 km disk scratches , vibrating from plastics , service not up to</p><p>mark, not experienced service technicians.. Apart from that bike satisfy your</p><p>need . But don't expect mileage it will be 20km. And throttle power don't be expect till first service completion .. Abs working good</p>",3,neg,bikewale,25-04-2018
Not worthy for 2 lakhs,"Cons: 1. May be most of them in the reviews mentioned that good bike! but when you go for a long ride(150km) focus on the fuel level display it wont update properly, it will update with correct bars when you do key off and key  on else it wont update, i faced this issue.2. Some times while going fast if you apply back brake there will be small stuck sound(may be not in all bikes).Pro:You never feel back pain with this handle.Dual abs is an advantage.There are no proper technicians/service center in the market for dominar. It could be better if they can add gear number on the display.Horn sound is some what irritating for this bike.",3,neg,bikewale,25-05-2018
Layman's review,"<p>Before going into depth i would like to impart few points about me so that people who are in a position similar to me can get best of my review.</p><p>I am a common man and not a bike geek like who get into the depth of thrust, power etc.. I use my bike for day to day city rides, twice a month for long rides of around 450 km. My height is around 171 cm and weight is 70 kg (this is important while you handle 180 kilos of machine).</p><p>1. Buying experience.</p><p>Showroom people are friendly and they gave bike for test ride and explained its features. However this was their first set of bike since its new launch they are not aware about minute details.</p><p>2. Riding and ownership experience.</p><p>Before going into depth i would like to impart few points about me so that people who are in a position similar to me can get best of my review.</p><p>I am a common man and not a bike geek like who get into the depth of thrust, power etc.. I use my bike for day to day city rides, twice a month for long rides of around 450 km. My height is around 171 cm and weight is 70 kg (this is important while you handle 180 kilos of machine).</p><p> that’s about me. Lets get straight into review with two categories, negative and positive.</p><p>Negatives:-</p><p>Like i said i am a layman and i don’t even know that these bikes don’t have middle stand and kick rod to start. After careful reviews, i decided to buy then realised in showroom that these are missing however i went ahead and bought due to super positive reviews. I have to mention them here because</p><p>1)	design & quality of side stand provided is ultra poor. Some times i doubt that bike may collapse. It’s a poor design because even 120 kilos platina has same diameter stand. Quality is poor because it started getting rust immediately after three months.</p><p>2)	i have received broken battery with new bike. One fine day i tried to start my bike but couldn’t, then immediately called service centre. They verified and confirmed that battery is broken. They go on and mentioned that they can’t be responsible for battery and tyres according to their nature. I fought with them that how can my battery is broken after a run of hardly 500 km. Finally they convinced and mentioned that it has to be replaced, which takes a minimum of 21 days. Again i managed to push them to delivery in five days.</p><p>3)	i started getting strange chain noise from a week of sale. When i enquired with service centre they mentioned that chain lubricant must be applied for each and every 500 km. I told them i haven’t even rode 200 km then how come noise is coming. Finally i understood that it’s a design flaw and you must apply chain lubricant for every 150 km. So before going for a ride of more than 150 km keep a bottle of chain lubricant in your bag.</p><p>Above points were till my first service experience. Then during the 3rd month of my ownership, one fine day i found a pool of oil around my bike. I called service centre immediately. They again appeared and confirmed that bike's back shock absorber is damaged and it is a manufacturing defect however i can ride my bike till i get replacement by company which may take another 21 days but be careful while driving. Limit speed to 50 kmph. I got replacement after 21 days along with back pain. ? .</p><p>There is no hook facility to hang bags and you can’t put one as well. No options for that. So you must carry your helmet wherever you go. No shopping if you don’t have back pack.</p><p>Another flaw with bike is handling. This is very very important and valid point. Its very hard to handle in normal city traffics and curves. Trust me my i20’s turning radius is far better than dominar. I would have fallen badly with my kid if i am not extra careful. So be aware. Handling of this beast is disaster trust me.</p><p>There is something terribly wrong with gear ration of bike. Even after riding 4000 km i am not able to understand how they work and bike get stops very often under slow speeds. I found a fuel issue with a speed of 50 km, accelerator is not working then. </p><p>Positives.:-</p><p>Speed speed speed. I rode more than 140 kmph but no vibrations at all. Excellent pickup and great speed. Even at that speed you can feel very confident. </p><p>Brakes ( i have abs version). Bike just stand idle on wheels whenever you want them. Brakes work like heaven. So you can have best control of the bike at any speed.</p><p>Head light, i don’t see much advantage in it but i feel the difference. When you have better while led while all other struggling with yellow lamp lights.</p>",3,neg,bikewale,25-04-2018
Ownership review 1 year 50-70 kms of daily commute,"Bought in october 2017, first generation. Was very excited about it and still is, but bajaj is bajaj after all. Considering the price it off-course is a value for money proposition. But ride and paint quality could have been better. It's been a year i have faced the issues with bike: Cons 1.) suspensions are too hard for Indian roads, roads in delhi are good but an unexpected pothole is sufficient to shock your kidneys.2.) power lag- despite of using all the recommended procedures. Had to switch to motul engine oil, which made a slight decrease in engine buzz onto the handle bars. But sometimes feels like a 2-3k capacity motorcycle. I don't know how a r15 guy manage to pull off the bike faster than me at the signals despite of using the accelerator at the fullest.3.) chain lubrication is required very frequently or else you will start feeling the difference within 300 kms.  4.) gear thud is annoying.  Pros 
 1.) value for money for a 400 cc2.) build quality is solid. Never experienced any loose parts despite of being plastic heavily utilized on dominar. 3.) feature packed.",3,neg,bikewale,25-11-2018
Engine heat up,"I have buyed the new dominar 400 2019 variant. I would like to share my views about the riding experience - the performance is no doubt an excellent one but the heating of engine is a serious concern. I bought my bike 9 days ago. And today when i started from my home to office the engine caught fire and all the wired cables got burnt. It's all smoke and heat coming out from the bike. I hardly travelled 5 kms and the engine got so heated up that it caught fire, though the bike was standing for whole night so it's no chance for the engine to be warm before hand. Too bad for a riding experience, not expected from such a brand new bike.I finally called the tow truck to take the bike to the workshop.",1,neg,bikewale,22-04-2019
Amazing ride quality,The riding experience on this bike is sublime. It ruins you in a way that other indian bike feel like a drag. You need to feel the power. I have travelled at a constant speed of over 120 on this bike for an hour. The ride is smooth. It has power like sports bike. It can also cruise. It becomes a wonderful bike for people who are tall. Would not really recommend you to buy it if you are less than 5 8 in height.,5,pos,bikewale,21-04-2019
Beast with intense roar,"Had an amazing time riding this sports cruiser, the best thing about it was the sound of the stock exhaust, it was superb experience on the whole. Another appealing thing of this bike was it head mask and its tail light. The led placement in the front light gives it a beast look and it's meter on tank gives it a very elegant look.",5,pos,bikewale,11-04-2019
A complete package ,Awesome looking bike new model is best bike for daily commute the new mirrors are attention seeking. Rims are too good as compared before which were golden and the color combination is also too good.  Power too is improved too much. It is just a complete package at an affordable price. I own a classic 350 but i am thinking forward too own this bike sson.,5,pos,bikewale,25-03-2019
Unbelievable performance,"It's very good and performance also good but mileage is less than 20,but look is awesome it is cheaper when comparing to other vehicle like ktm, yamaha,suzuki,royal enfield it is better than all.It has abs( advance braking system) so less chance to feel down . It's not just a bike . It's a superbike.",5,pos,bikewale,25-03-2019
Dominar -  your own devil,"Once you sit on the bike, you feel as if you have command over the roads, it’s that nimble, easy to manoeuvre and provides great front end feel. The more you ride it the more refined the engine gets, and after 4500 kms it’s smooth as butter, and believe me you, 35 horses combined with 35 nm of torque is enough to never let you get bored of the bike. Overtaking is fun and thrilling, and brakes are reassuring. For this price you won’t find anything better in any market, at night the dark matte black bike lets you believe you are batman, so put in your cape and ride through the darkness.",5,pos,bikewale,25-03-2019

Stunning new 6 month old dominar ,"Pretty awesome bike. Abs works like charm. Slipper clutch is added benefits and makes ride smooth. Its the best sports cruiser you can have.

It makes awesome sound especially when you rev in the mid range.",5,pos,bikewale,18-04-2019
New diamond cut alloy wheels ,Dominar 400 pretty good in look as well &  there 400 cc powerful engine with air cooled system technology. New green black colour with diamond cut alloy wheels.

The rider 10,"As bajaj has done a wonderful job and it looks naked in dominar 400, my buying experience was very good. The service staff were helpful, they gave me every needed information i wanted and also what i even didn't knew.I almost done about 12000km and still i'm in no mood to discontinue. The riding is so smooth that i almost forget my other issues (that can be a con in other way).I would give dominar 4 out of 5 in looks but, the performance really very good. You can really count on dominar if you really need a buddy.As dominar is an indian bike and obviously we are in india the spare parts are easily available and is not very expensive, the service cost is also not high as ktm bikes but yeah you will have to find a good mechanic for your bike as many mechanics didn't knew about many things which are unique in dominar.The dual channel abs provides a very safe ride, dominar feels very grippy on the roads, and also the heating issues are not felt because of the liquid cooled engine, you will hardly feel the radiator. The vibrations are some kind of issue but according to me i don't have any problem with a bit of vibrations.",5,pos,bikewale,28-03-2019
Bajaj dominar - all rounder and value for money,"The bike is simply great. Unbeatable in value for money.1.

Hyper review,"Nice bike with powerful engine, performance is good. Excellent bike under 2 lakhs. Compare to apache 310 dominar is better.

Too good ,"It's such a nice bike under 2 lakh but main point is the bajaj dominar 400 is most superior than other bikes as you can see the other companies as like re, kawasaki , and other brands are providing the different issues for the different qualities. Compromising the similarities to this bike i mean dominar is awesome but mileage consumption is too poor but i don't have any problem.",5,pos,bikewale,25-03-2019

Value for mine,"1. Buying experience Ans: i purchased bike from kalyani bajaj yelahanka bangalore karnataka. They have put staff untrained, they were incapable of explaining a single point of bike . After struggling for 15 min they gave me product catalog and told me please go through that you will find your answer. The next shock is that when i booked the bike after paying 5000 and they told please come tomorrow and pay full amount and take the bike , in front of everybody i did imps for the remaining amount and it took 45 min to confirm me that the amount is credited and you can take the bike .2. Riding experience Answer: there are various factors which is responsible for comfortable riding in which i will explain some if the point here .A. Riding posture- by looking at the bike we can see the bike is meant for touring and some what commuting ( since it is very high power few people prefer to commute on this again mileage is factor )B. 373 cc liquid cooled engine gives you a very good power and abs give you a good control on that power .C. Looks - is stunning , great led headlamps Led indicators sharp detailing on paint job .D. Performance- i am not adding the specifications that is already on bikewale.Com i will just explain what we are getting on this bike : 373 cc engine which is borrowed from ktm gives you stunning pickup as well as torque. Service and maintenance: as this is bajaj bike so service cost is lower than any of the bike in this category and the service period is whooping 5k km but you have to ve care full for engine oil topup ans chain lubing .Paid service generally cost you around 25k to 3k if minor part change is there Pros: value for money for every bit build for indian road , you can literally take this bike anywhere ( i did some long tour including adventures)Large wheel base ans disk for effective braking Dual instrument cluster  cons: no abs switch no fuel tap ab bit heavy (182 kgs ).",4,pos,bikewale,25-03-2019
Good bike for touring ,I love this bike because dominar 400 is a good touring bike in 400cc segment it is a value for money bike and i feel good satisfaction with this bike because i am a short boy but i can easily control this bike.

Its a beast on the road to dominate others bikes,"I'm traveled more than  14000 kms in 5 months, with my whole experience in city, highways, off roads, ghat roads, i never feel any kind of difficulty. Only the things is service centers in hyderabad, in some service center engineers are not trained to do service for this bike. Maintenance cost till my bike is ""zero""....",5,pos,bikewale,25-02-2019
The actual performance motorcycle India deserves.,"It's a great motorcycle from the bajaj stable. I can go on boasting about its looks, performance, comfort, etc. But most importantly what bajaj has given us is a vfm product which can crunch miles like a morning breakfast as well as tidy up those city commutes.Starting on with the appearance, it's a looker. Everyone out there will surely give a glance at it, even if it's a small one, just for the front approach. It's big and those fang like led drls are amazing and does the task efficiently. The side profile too is big. It has got that superbike-esque feeling even when one is astride.The performance is amazing, though not like the duke 390 but only tad less than it due to the dominar's sheer weight. The torque is quite punchy and picks up the revs quickly and in no time one might be doing triple digits. Gearbox is fine but shifting to 1st from n makes that loud inevitable clunk sound, from then on its a breeze. Due to the weight, straight line stability is brilliant, but fuel efficiency takes a hit giving around 32 in highways and 27 in cities if ridden sedately. The exhaust note has got a throaty pinch to it. Riding position is very relaxed, with the raised handlebars and slight rear set foot pegs. One can go for long trips without any hassles. Pillion comfort is also good, if not best. Cornering is not a problem, but considering the weight and the motorcycle geometry, it's not meant for it. It's a sports cruiser, the sweet spot being 120-25, though it can do 150+. Features wise it is loaded with full digital console(dual), dual channel-abs, slipper clutch, those beautiful led headlamps(usp), liquid cooling, fuel injection, etc and all under 1.9 lakhs on road(guwahati). The parts are cheap too, as it is bajaj. Normal servicing would cost under 1.5k. On the negative side, there are not many but important ones like the clunky 1st gear and weird crashing sounds are heard towards the rear end of the motorcycle while riding over potholes or bad patches of roads, might be a bajaj thing. But overall it's a vfm sports cruiser given by bajaj meant to rule the highways, subtracting the quality niggles. Should you buy one, yes definitely.",4,pos,bikewale,25-02-2019
My dominar - the perfect touring machine,"1. Buying experience - i have decided to buy a dominar blue 2018 version in the late 2017. I booked the vehicle on 15th January 2018 but i have to wait for more than a month to get the color i asked for. The showroom guys are not at all helpful when i call to check the delivery status they keep on repeating it is not in production. I sent a complaint mail to the regional head then i got a call from the showroom and arranged the bike in mid February.   Finally I received my bike my dad took the bike from the showroom as i was not available in town. Wow i was in love with the color and the muscles. But my buying experience is not fruitful its the worst. 2. Riding experience - after doing the test drive i was totally in love with this beast. The riding quality is awesome. Can hit 3 digit speeds in fewer seconds. There are small vibrations when you cross 6000+ rpm. The seat is comfortable only for the rider and for pillion the seating could be done better (not comfortable for long rides). Its more than a year now but i am always amazed to ignite the bike for a ride. The brakes are powerful can rely on them . Overall the riding quality is fantastic.3. Details about looks, performance etc - its the absolute beauty with the muscles. The led headlamp is the best in class. The looks of the bike is somewhat similar to pulsar ns. The golden alloy combination is the coolest. Performance wise the bike is value for money can ride for hours without breaking a sweat. The abs and slipper clutch are the added advantages. The fuel tank capacity is 13 l. It is a small quantity for such a big beast. The mileage is ok. In city i will be getting 25 to 27 km pl in highway rides i get 31 - 34 km pl. I usually fill the tank ride for 300 km and again refill the tank. Seeing the looks and performance it is the only value for money bike in the 350+ cc segment. 4. Servicing and maintenance -  the service provided is very cheap. (i mean the personnel's knowledge not the service fee) i have a screech sound in my bike which is not solved till this day even after servicing the bike for 5 times. The showroom service staffs are not having adequate knowledge to service the bikes. (it is described in the user manual not to wash the digital controls of the bike with pressurized water but the service people never care about this. Even if i ask them them to lube the chain they lube it without removing the dirt / without cleaning the chain. The service quality provided for this high end bike is very very poor. Bajaj needs to improve a lot. Maintenance concerned,  it is required to lube the chain after every 500 kms. The spares and service charges are cheaper compared to other brands. Yet the bike needs to be maintained regularly for smooth operation.5. Pros & cons :    pros : 1. Looks - the beautiful beast.   2. Performance - value for money.    3. Comfort - very good comfort for rider.  4. Spares price.  5. Stability on high speeds and long rides.   6. Decent mileage. 7. Killer price (vfm). Cons :   1. Service (very poor customer service & technical service).  2. Showroom - the showrooms are busy in showcasing 200 rs & ns & 150 as they are easy to sell. 3. After market accessories are difficult to find and expensive to buy.  4. The tank capacity should have been more.  5. The fuel indicator is not accurate only 2 points will be reduced for first 150 kms when the tank is full and all the remaining points will be gone for the next 100 kms.  6. Pillion seating is not comfortable.  7. Poor marketing strategy by bajaj.",4,pos,bikewale,25-02-2019
Beast with the beauty,"The bike not just looks class apart also beats with performance and value for money.I'd rather say this as a teenager dressed up in a matured attire. Teenager simile here is for the ktm's 390 engine detuned perfectly with chiseled art work of bajaj.It's been my pal lately to whom i've been started talking to lately.

I'd strongly say that bajaj dominar is one among the greatest to do ride on indian terrain which is a damn mixture of good and bad.....Yeah very good in looks (hot & bold)Good in mileage & in performance.

The people who really own this know what this machine is up to. i loved every bit of it, some very minor issue were there but they all were negligible.

Review,The bike from which one of the men best can get the love the passion and the endurance of the bike is the key to the comfort the best bike i will prefer to the bikers and i love to drive this . This is the best of the beast of the bikes . I love  dominar . To dominate the world of the bikers. I am very happy to get this bike.,4,pos,bikewale,25-01-2019
Lets dominate the road with the most vfm bike,Bike is simply awesome. No doubt one of the best in segment. Everything is good for me. But the only thing i don't like is it's lower rpm stability. Bike is refined and smooth in higher rpm but in city when you are cruising at 22-25 kmph bike is unstable. Headlight is superb. Bajaj should include the gear position indicator because dominar is their premium segment bike.,5,pos,bikewale,25-01-2019
should buy this bike it's not like the pulsar series which gives problems overtime,"first the buying experience was really good, i stay in pcmc area there are 2 showroom near me one is near nigdi that showroom is shit, the showroom people don't even explain all the features of the bike, so i decided to go wakadewadi showroom there people really treat u well, hence buying experience was awesome. next riding experience is great for cruising on highways, it's a bit hard to control on small road and traffic though it weighs about 180kg doesn't feel that heavy. looks of the bike is ok ok for me i purchased this bike just for the performance and features that bajaj is providing for just 2lac, i m too much satisfied about the performance, again don't expect it will give power like ktm 390 as dominar is categorised under cruiser, next servicing doesn't cost that much free servicing cost arnd 1200-1300 and paid i guess around 1500-1700, pros- the headlights are very powerful no need to install extra lights, comfortable seat easily u can ride 4 hrs straight, no sweat, the performance is great, brakes are very responsive.. nd now the cons- pillion seat is really bad after half an hour your body is gonna pain, they should include gear indicator, and should have given michelin tyres, mrf rev's aren't that bad though.",5,pos,bikewale,25-01-2019
Tourer bike,"Awesome bike i really proud it. This bike is best for tourer person. If you want to like sports look and latest technologies then buy dominar.

Also, i'm a daily commuter, an office going guy, who commutes around 30-35 km daily.",5,pos,bikewale,25-01-2019
Value for money ,"Don't buy from panvel raigad bajaj. Default rear suspension settings is not good for overall rides.Looks are simply amazing , ktm engine performance is amazing on dominar 400.

Dominar 400 - the best from bajaj as yet ,"After having researched & test driven almost all 200 cc & above bikes and at a time when i was almost going to buy the dominar our car gave major problems and we had to buy a new car instead. Heartbroken, i moved on, but, with a secret promise of buying one when my finances would allow.Well the wait did not last too long as within a few months we were at it again. Now confused between the bajaj dominar and the re thunderbird 350-x abs. After going through a lot of owner reviews and forums of both the machines and also due to the persistence of a very dear friend i decided to go with the dominar. However, the dealers in my city had sold out the stocks and we were asked to wait for the upgraded version launching early 2019. Opportunity knocked once again and we got a very good deal on a second hand one which was barely ridden 4500 kms in seven months. And boy i don't regret my decision one bit. The bike is just amazing.....Its as planted on the highways as it is agile on the city roads. Its cornering abilities are spot on and the power it offers is just reassuring especially when you overtake on the highways. The suspension could have been a bit softer, but that is purely my personal choice. Another lacunae is the limited info on the display, i hope that bajaj will work on this front in the upgrade.The pillion rider will be comfortable for up to distances of 50-60 km at a stretch after which a short break would be good. This i have personally experienced on the back seat of my friend's dominar on one of his sunday rides. On the other hand, the rider's seat is just perfect. It makes you feel one with the machine. You instantly connect with the bike and the bike gives you loads of confidence on the road. Kudos to bajaj on this front. The engine delivers well on the highways whereas in the city you would have to shift gears quite occasionally. Cruising speeds of 80-90 kmph are a breeze and anything above 100 kmph will empty your fuel tank faster. As a matter of fact i have been able to touch 115 kmph that too with a pillion. This may not be a big feat for many, but for me it was a first.Overall i would say that this is a value for money bike that bajaj has come up with and though there is room for improvement the current version is not a deal breaker at all. Bajaj dominar is a perfect set of wheels for new riders like me who want to explore the joy of long distance rides on the highways and country roads.  Dominar 400d is undoubtedly the best product from the bajaj stable till date ! ! !",5,pos,bikewale,25-12-2018
Bajaj dominar  never cease to amaze me ,"I never considered bajaj as a brand for my new vehicles. I always wanted either  Japanese or good rivals like ktm etc. When searching for best vfm bike under 2 lakh category  & needed a 300-400 cc segmented motorbike that is when dominar made into my list. While watching videos, passing through we feel dominar as a normal bike but it isn't. I went to service centre test rode it and it the feeling was a wow .Never test rode any other except mojo and decided it go with my first non-Japanese Indian  brand bajaj. Now coming to my ownership review clocked 13000 and it has been 1 year 1 month.The wow i mentioned above its a big wow now.The bike is awesome and many cons mentioned here in the reviews is because bajaj uses their engine oil for every bike to provide warranty based on that and that is engine oil is very bad. Use motul ,liquimoly or addinol dominar performs much better with no vibrations , better shifting and thus better peace of mind.Performance it is  5/5,the best vfm under 300-400 category including sports bikes. Even have faster acceleration than apache rr310. Looks it passes and feel as normal bike but when you enter it and ride it you feel like you are riding a big super bike.Stability is very very excellent.And bajaj wonder is when it comes to servicing , in my area aluva,kerala. I had the best service from bajaj not just praising bajaj service quality here is very high and maintenance and service cost for a dominar is very low comparing to other 300cc bikes which is a boon for me.During riding the pillion and rider comfort is excellent because of the large seat.Night visibility is very high and the led headlights are awesome.Pros:-1. Best instrument cluster , second to new ktm 390.2. Best stable vfm bike under 400cc for touring.3. Very low maintenance and servicing cost.4.Headlight is very powerful.5.Performance is second to none for the amount paid.6.Slipper clutch works like a charm 7. Breaking is excellent including abs 8.Excellent service from bajaj. 9. Good pillion and rider seat. 10.Paint quality is very good.11. Stable at top speeds due to its weight.12. No heating issues like ktm or rr310. Cons:1. Crash guard not impressive. 2. Bigger fuel tank is needed for touring. 3. Bajaj pressuring us to use their engine oil to get warranty. 4. Dome is not impressive it could have been smaller but that depends on users.5. No gear indicator. 6. Less turn radius (very bad during traffic to filter through vehicles)7. Gearshift hard due to bajaj oil.8.Gearshift sound due to bajaj oil.",5,pos,bikewale,25-12-2018
Dominar 400 the beast,Very comfort in riding.. Abs works good in wet condition also.. Reduce speed from 100 to 0 within 50 meter..Service cost is low compared to ktm. Required less maintenance. Pillion seat is also comfortable..Pillion rider will feel comfortable for long trip..My experience about top speed is 158 Cons:1.Colour quality 2.Headlight work less in fog condition.3. Gear indication missing.,5,pos,bikewale,25-12-2018
Excellent vfm,The dominar 400 is one of the most value for money bikes in India and competes with the bikes which are a lot more expensive than itself. It is a great commuter as well as tourer. Vibrations are there but it feels very powerful because of that 35 nm of torque that the 373 cc engine produces. It's the same engine that's used in the duke and rc 390 but is retunned. Riding position and posture is upright and comfortable making it one of the best for long rides. Bajaj calls it a power cruiser and i think it happily lives up to it's name. Great bike but didn't get a lot of attention from our market because people are blindly choosing royal enfield despite of dominar being 10 times better than re.,4,pos,bikewale,25-12-2018
Affordable beast!,"Bajaj dominar or ktm 390? I know many of you will not even check the specifications of this bike before buying if it was the born in ktm family. Despite 400cc engine bajaj  gifted us the dominar in just rs.185k(as on 2016).Never the same it may be a bajaj product but it has gene of duke 390. It my be not faster than duke but its linear, its comfortable to ride it continuously 300 kilometers in my experience. The 10 led headlamps works like charm in the night. Throttle response is ok. Power is more than enough. I like most about the weight distribution of this bike, high speed stability is great.Service cost is minimum as 200cc bikes. Free services cost around rs.1000-1200, it's nothing for a 400cc and you have an option for annual amc offerings from bajaj officials. Its cost me around rs.1700 for 4 free services valid for 1 year.If i talk to you about the pros & cons, the bike is all about pros, hehe. In this price point no bike is better than dominar. About cons it has some little chain noise because of the hard chain sliders.Happy buying.",5,pos,bikewale,25-12-2018
Problem,"Please avoid buying this so call 373 cc bike - dominar 400. All other bikes which are lesser in cc gives more performance / top speed. You will regret everyday for buying this piece of shit. Fuel injection is always been a problem, gives less power and very less mileage. Chain sprocket and chain is always been a problem, you will have to visit service centre twice in a week. Poor quality plastics, rubber metal frame.An all purpose bike. Excellent grip in highways. You will love in ghat sections. Led headlight is head turner. Maintenance cost is economical. Suggestion to company: please increase the rpm limit and provide windshield.",5,pos,bikewale,25-12-2018
THE TRUE BEAST  under 2 lakhs segment,"I have a Red Dominar 400 bought it on 18th March 2018, it's a great machine made by bajaj. The power delivery is very linear and the engine has enough torque to pull the bike with ease even at lower gears. Initially there were vibrations in the bike ( handle bar, rider seat n foot pegs) between 4500-5000 rpm. but now I do not feel any vibrations. I have completed 9000 kilometres in ODO. The bike is now buttery smooth. My 3rd and last free service is left to be done. Overall it is a value for money machine.

highway mileage : 30-32kmpl.",5,pos,bikewale,25-12-2018
Dominar is best,Bajaj dominar 400 is very wonderful bike in this segment. Its power is really best and breaking system with abs is too much good. Personally i like dominar 400 in this price. I suggest u should buy dominar 400..Looks wise this bike is also better.Handling is very comfortable. Mileage is good according to this segment..I am genuinely saying..I loved it.,5,pos,bikewale,25-12-2018
A well packed and totally balanced bike dominar,"Totally the bike is amazing. I'm really surprised that it really is a bajaj product, it really didn't feels like that, it's handling, controls, body feel, total user experience, and many more to say about.It has good riding height, suspension and the weight balance of the bike is really well managed; though it's vibrations feels a bit more sometimes while riding at really high speeds; but on normal speed is like as smooth as butter.For a 400cc engine it's mileage is also good which is about 18-20 kmpl at high city traffics and easily 29-35kmpl at highway.Overall, dominar is a well packed beast with a total balance of everything.",5,pos,bikewale,25-12-2018
Dominar-400 beast!! honest review after 10 months 11000 kms!! daily commute. Must read,"1. Buying experience :- no issue in buying motorcycle, i bought from suman bajaj noida and there were no issues in payment and insurance options.2 . Riding experience :- woho that's what i feel everyday , what an amazing power this machine has, you will be short of roads but this bike never disappoints when it comes to power and braking , my preference is normal brakes plus engine brake which makes the bike more stable when it comes to braking. Excellent pickup when it comes highway or city no issues at all in performance and riding. I daily commute to office in noida and daily i enjoy my ride. 3. Details about looks, performance etc. Looks are top notch muscular look , there will be many people who will notice looks it's white led lights are stunning which gives clear and sharp visibility 4. Servicing and maintenance:- service cost includes 1010 which includes synthetic engine bajaj  (total) plus oil filter 74 inr and air filter 265(change in third service) inr , that's all folks . Although after 25000 kms  you have to change the chain sprocket which comes around 3400 inr with labour that is only major change when it comes to service in the normal wear and tier. I have many fellow friends its very genuine rate as compare to other 400 cc bikes, this is normal rate. Pros and cons 1. Ultimate riding and acceleration experience 2.  Best pick up in this price range 3. Mileage got around 28 in noida traffic and 31 on highway when i drive on 110 km/hr, if you drive around 80-90 you will get 32+ easily , i went to leh no issues at all got average around 32 lol in hills4. White led which makes it very premiumCons :-1. No cons at all  just vibrations which makes irritating sometimes. Go to good service center of bajaj when it comes to servicing , not every mechanic of svc is capable of doing service this bike. I prefer delhi kirti nagar 2. No cons since price is below 2 lakhs if you go for ktm and duke they are way expensive. 3. White led is not spread which makes it difficult to ride in hills. I repeat only on hills , for that i got fog lamps that's all folks!!Take test ride and feel it's power you will come to know what i am saying !!",5,pos,bikewale,25-11-2018

About the maintenance and user friendly bike ,Bajaj dominar is awesome bike when we are comparing in the same category and pricing and riding experience is so good for comparing to other same cc bikes breaking performance it is awesome experience and about the services and all for this pricing bike dominar maintenance is very less so we can use regular usage some bike are charging good amount for services always bajaj spare parts is cheaper than any other bikes in India. And the maintenance also not that much for bajaj bikes so i preferred dominar powerful bike and maintenance cost also less so i suggest dominar.,5,pos,bikewale,25-11-2018
Not just a naked bike but a power cruiser,"Although bajaj advertises it as a power cruiser, at first sight i thought it looked and felt like a naked bike. Maybe they could have just called it a pulsar ns 400 and it would have made no difference. But after riding for a long rides of 600+ km at a stretch, now i understand why they were marketing it as a power cruiser or a hyper riding machine.There is little to no back pain even after sitting on the bike for 10 hours straight. Nor there is any strain on the engine. And the heat management is awesome in city. The only downsides i can mention is the break gear and clutch levers are of terrible quality and break even with minor falls.I didn't feel the wind blast would bother me as i ride at around 80 90 kmph speed and rarely touch 100+ but it did bother me and i had to put after market wind shield.This may be with my bike only but there is a problem with starting the bike, it starts normally when in neutral but when in gear most of the times it struggles to start.",5,pos,bikewale,25-11-2018

5. suspension is great on pot holed roads.
6. flicks like a race bike at speed.
Cons- 
1. the key lock comes loose quite often
2. chain rattling at slow speeds
3. You don't really know which gear you're in.
4. Gearbox is quite clunky
5. Clutch on the stiffer side.
6. vibrations on handle bar but quite mild.",5,pos,bikewale,25-11-2018
Never expect,When i brought domi home. I just feel like its time to explore. But the experience was just beyond my expectations.I just loved  the riding experience it is completely a sports tourer. The service and maintenance is ok. If it well maintained the domi just love you back and the experience will be riding in heaven.,4,pos,bikewale,25-11-2018
Me off my dominar,At the time when i bought the bike i thought maybe i am investing wrong because 400cc bike with 6 gears at such low price of its kind i thought it wouldn't give much performance but the ride over it gave a good confidence that it suit me very well. My father has a good belief on the company bajaj . And more over i like the white colour in the model .Everyday i go to college i find my bike helps me a lot as i have to ride over 3 km and without a bike it is difficult and with this bike it is more comfortable and enjoyable.The mileage of this bike is quite higher than other 400cc bikes when compared.I simply say this bike is all rounder in racing and financial issues.I love my bike...,5,pos,bikewale,25-11-2018
Excellent motorcycle can become a roadster or a tourer on your will,"The bike can behave like a “tourer” if you ride it like a touring machine and can become a “street fighter” at just a slight twist of the throttle just cross the 5000rpm mark and zoom pass everything near you. I would start with stating that the sales persons who dealt with me were really good and friendly and helpful (although i finally ended up buying the bike from a local dealer as i got it cheaper) also the service executives are great no complaints there. I’ve bought 2018 version of dominar in red colour and boy oh boy it’s a pure eye candy once you take the bike out every second person on the road notices the bike it seems to be a bigger capacity bike lets say a 600cc-650cc and the performance needless to say anything, at a price of 1.8l on road (that’s the price it costed me in the month of june) there is literally no other bike even near to that of the performance of a dominar 400 even a duke 200 might cost you the same or maybe 8-10k lesser in terms of performance there is no other bike even close to this one. Just to add a fun factor in the review, when my girlfriend first saw my bike i told her it was a ducati, she and her friends for almost 15-20 days didn’t knew it is a bajaj until i myself busted the truth.",5,pos,bikewale,25-11-2018
Little diavel....,"This bike is just awesome.I was wondering which one to buy  months back...Bought this bike  because from overall aspects it is the best in its class. It looks like little diavel. My buying experience was not that good but ok. Bajaj should give special treatment to dominar customers.Pros: looks is awesome, completely a head turner.Overall brakes are good,also the lights.Throttle response is not that of ktm type but ok. The slipper clutch helps shifting gears quite easy.Cons:first thing bajaj service. They don't give attention to any dominar at service centre, just treating like ordinary bike.Next are the rear brakes they are not that good comparing to the power the bike have.Also the vibration you will hear a little higher in 2nd or 3rd gear at 4k to 6k rpm , from tank from rear end .Overall a best bike i would say comparing to price ...",5,pos,bikewale,25-11-2018
Great bike,I'm buying my dominar from autoden bajaj mahim very nice and helpful staff good behaviour person and nice suggested me.Very nice riding position and controlling and power pickup all amazing really nice bike also nice looking like lion and low maintenance bike great bike i like so much i'm really appreciate it.,5,pos,bikewale,25-11-2018
Indian sports bike ,A best bike on this price best performance pickup in hills but mileage is not up to the mark it is even better than bmw g310r after seeing review from this site and after buying the information about the bike was  correct enough from bikewale thanks for the review from my thinking everything leaving the mileage is very brilliant best sports bike at cheap price and even it is from Indian company.,5,pos,bikewale,25-11-2018
Dominar's domination,"Purchased this big mean gorgeous machine worth 180k, around march this year, worried about the maintenance part but just costed me 1500 and a 1500 extra for a Teflon coating. I've been using it to commute around kolkata its just a sheer pleasure, power and comfort under your command.Best part about the bikes is its ergonomics, handling and the raw power coming out of the d400, well everything has a flaw; in this case maneuvering the bike and sudden vibrations crossing the 4000 rpm mark. This one bike you can rely for the rest of your life. Worth every single rupee spent.",4,pos,bikewale,25-10-2018
Indian beast,"What a bike... Love you dominar... Braking system is amazing... Abs system works flawlessly.........For touring, daily commuting it's amazing... Ride the top speed of 152 kmph... Mileage is around 25.. Service cost is 1200... Overall happy experience. Indian beast among bikes made by bajaj. Thank you",5,pos,bikewale,25-10-2018
Race machine,Dominar is my racing machine.. Its totally awesome and good looking... Great looks with super speed. I really appreciate it. My friends are also using this bike and they also like this bike.. And the main thing is the price of the bike is very good. Bajaj giving 400 cc. You can't compare this bike with any other bike.,5,pos,bikewale,25-10-2018
The perfect beast for Indian road,Buying experience was fine. Not too great. Bike spreads it's wings after 2000km. It becomes a true beast after that. 29-30kmpl Mileage. Very very powerful for Indian Roads but apt for highways. Servicing is not that expensive but affordable. Very comfortable. It goes really fast once you roll the throttle. It is my first bike. I am quite amazed.,4,pos,bikewale,25-10-2018
One of my dreams,"I feel awesome @ riding dominar 400, its like super sport bike feels, but i can't ride it on national highway that my bad luck otherwise i will tell you all the top of speed of dominar 400, but i am sure about it's driving will feel me that i am in heaven highway., it will be mine before this diwali, i am just waiting for that day...",5,pos,bikewale,25-10-2018
Awesome ,"This is a great bike, in reasonable price.It has 'dual channel' abs which is awesome for braking system. It is also comfortable, with power. It is for long highway rides, but you can also drive it in the city @ 28kmpl. It is so reliable and good. It's handling is damn good. I love this bike and hope you too.",5,pos,bikewale,25-10-2018
Middle class mans dream,Why i bought this bike 1) i need a ktm machine 2) price should be less than 2 lakhs with abs 400cc 3) adequate seat to ride with mom and girlfriend 3) aggressive look I think its d only bike in this segment can satisfy my odds so i choose dominar as my pair that why i choose dominor its far better than enfield.,5,pos,bikewale,25-09-2018
Very good vfm bike,"Good buying experience,smooth less vibrations,awesome look with chunky and good exhaust,good service charges and maintenance free and good mileage, value  for money performance bike,good ground clearance but it has no gear positioning indicator and has hard up shifts,rear wheel feel slightly wooden..",5,pos,bikewale,25-09-2018
My genuine riding experience,"Bajaj dominar 400 is really impressive on its performance and stability but not at all how is its looks. Its a good performing machine with 35 bhp provides hyper acceleration and power delivery also this is more than expected from bajaj. As usual, when we compare dominar with duke 390, there is a considerable variation on bhp and performance as well. But dominar is a motorcycle made for safety, durability and performance together compared to duke 390. Even though both having similar specifications, dominar having slipper clutch and dual channel abs gives an extra safety star, also the weight is identical to its power and breaking so that this gives more sustainability even in higher speed than duke. On this segment of bikes we should not consider service cost and mileage because these bikes are not made for those who considers, but this is clear, dominar considered its durability and mileage along with performance, this is a combination of these three facts.This is not a racing bike, but is a perfect one for long riders with 13 l fuel tank (9.5 l in duke) who considered power and performance along with safety the most to the rider and pillion. I am not a fan of dominar nor duke, but this is made for who are little bit more matured than a duke rider.",4,pos,bikewale,25-09-2018
Review,They best bike at this price range ... With abs best affordable all round bike..The best nice bike at range it gives good mileage...  So try buying it as it is also very aggressive n good looking at this price point good bike nice sporty buy it so u can know how fun it i to ride in their dominar please  try it's truly amazing.,5,pos,bikewale,25-09-2018
Joy to ride,"The buying experience was hassle free and smooth,riding this bike is pure joy its stable solid and smooth with progressive delivery of power,the bike looks gorgeous for me,the performance is very good be it in the traffic or cruising on the highway there is no problem at all,the weight is well distributed that u never feel its a 182kg bike,the only time u feel the weight is when u have to move it manually, coming to service i was a bit worried about bajaj's reputation about post sales servicing, but its much better than what i expected, finally i have owned this bike for over an year and it has given zero problems till date, the best value for money.",5,pos,bikewale,25-09-2018
Wonderful Advanced Machine! I don't know why people buy that Haathi,Been using it for one and a half years. No parts changed except front brake pads. No issues regarding performance. Wonderful acceleration and top speed. Good grip on the road. ABS works fine. It is a head turner. Only thing not so good is the fuel efficiency. Also the rear view mirrors show a bit of your shoulders.,5,pos,bikewale,25-09-2018
no words for the BEAST,"I was looking for a bike within my budget and should be classy. i had test ridden many bikes like bajaj Avenger, TVS Apache RTR 200 4V , royal Enfield thunderbird 350x and many more. still I couldn't get that feel when I rode these bikes. but one day I went to bajaj showroom and took test ride of dominar 400. omg as soon as I sat on the bike and start the bike, it gave me goosebumps. what a bike man.. I took as short ride of about a km. so easy bike, good handling, great power, awesome looks. ufff.. at the very same moment booked the bike. now waiting for the delivery. Bajaj dominar is the best bike to consider in 2018. go for it.",5,pos,bikewale,25-09-2018
Twinkle twinkle little star dominar is the super star,One of the best bike in this segment from bajaj is really stunning. Unlike other bikes i can feel the throttle every moment and this is the first time where even after a long run there seems no place of tiredness either to me or for the bike... To cut short i really love it.... Hats off to bajaj and would expect for more of the same from different brands.,5,pos,bikewale,25-09-2018
Power comfort  and agility,It's the king of cruiser in India right now.It will full fill your every need staring from race to long tour without exhausting you.Amazing power within this price range.Gear shift and mileage  could be better .Pillion seat could have been more comfortable.Except this every thing is fine and good .You can enjoy it in hill ride too.,5,pos,bikewale,25-09-2018

I didn't face any 1 issue with this bike it's very comfortable than any other bike for adventure touring ,you can run your bike at 120  km/h for atleast 350 km without any stop easily.Performance is awesome in  compared to any bike in this segment.Service cost is less Abs and fuel injection works awesome with power full engine.",5,pos,bikewale,25-09-2018
Enjoy the every day commuting city ride and Turing...,"I want to tell you something...
in under 2 lacs... the fuel injection, slipper clutch, fully LED headlamps, liquid cooled, dual channel abs...
what else you want...
that is dominar 400, the value for money machine. it's very cool smooth riding machine. I had a 220 F, dominar is the upgrade from 220 F. when I am looking for a big cc bike, my list 390 Duke, dominar, and Mojo... I don't have much money for 390 Duke, it's a good machine is better than dominar and Mojo. and Mojo is  300cc bike but, the performance and some other features is missing in Mojo. so I am go for the dominar.
the first service is done I recommend the Motul synthetic oil. it's good for the good engine performance like a smooth riding, gear shifting and the engine heating issue. heating issue is very manageable, I am there don't worry about that.
dominar is 373 cc, its ok 35hp, 35nm. the power is linear, you can manage the handling, the riding comfort is excellent.
I gave 4 star, because I am not impressed with the breaking. is a dual channel abs, the abs is ok but the breaking...I am not satisfied with that. I think the stopping power is  need to improve. and also it's a heavy machine 182 kg. and the vibration, its start vibrating from 110-120kmph.
the vibrations are in handlebar clutch levers foot pegs. is not too much like Royal Enfield bikes. the fibre parts in front of the tank that's  vibrating more... you can forget this all because under 2 lakh on road price 1.83 lakh, you can't get any bike like this cc in Indian market..
nothing is perfect, I love my dominar, he is my best buddy.... it's amazing..",4,pos,bikewale,25-09-2018
Dominate the roads,"Looking for powerful ride with the best safety features? dominar is the bike for you, it's a budget premium bike with amazing features. Bought this bike over an year ago and this bike had levelled up my touring experience. Have done 3k+ rides in week without atmost comfort and confidence. With best led lamps, body, cornering, agility, mid range rpm power/torque this bike truly a beast on road. Highly recommended, buy this bike if you truly want to experience long rides. Few mods like handle bar extenders and visor setup with improve the experience further, you don't need do anything else. Bajaj has done it's best to make it great package.",5,pos,bikewale,25-09-2018
Value for money worth buying,"I bought this bike on Feb 14, 2018 by exchanging royal enfield bullet 500 and i have the opinion that dominar is far better than bullet 5001. Better choice than buying a re bike 2.Riding position is very good 3.Maintenance cost is less compared to other bikes in this segment 4.High performance and fuel efficiency 5.Service cost us around 1200 on every 4500 kms.",5,pos,bikewale,25-08-2018
Domi-the beast ,"It was going to be a first bike and i was waiting for bajaj to launch at a price close to then my favourite rs 200.Later in 2016 they launched and i booked my bike on 15 jan 2017. Everyone said wait for the review and let it settle the market.But i have already made a choice and was not going to look back.There was enough reason to back my choice..It has everything what i needed.Power ,look , comfortable and up to date with technology.Well during the test ride it didn't fell that heavy and i was mesmerised by its power.Before riding domi 400 i just had experience of 200 cc engines so i was little afraid to pull the throttle to max.After riding it for 3 months ,i got used to the power of her's.Later in may i took my anarkali to pondichery which is close to 500km approx from bengaluru. To my surprise it never heated up even aafter constantly running on 120+ km on speedo. Later in went for shorter rides and all those went well.I own this beast for around year and half now and this beast has never betrayed me neither has disappointed me at any point of time. She is close to her fourth servicing now.Servicing has been little easy on my pocket till now.The thing which have disappointed me every time is the rear tyre and the rear breaks.Though after changing them after 14k has done alot.",4,pos,bikewale,25-08-2018
best bike in this segment,best value for money bike in India. the buy experience was great the Bajaj dealership was excellent. they were very polite. and the best bike in this segment. there are a little bit of vibration near 4000rpm but it only encourages you to pull harder. i just love this bike. well done Bajaj and keep up the good work. we hope to see an even better product as you and triumph are working together.,5,pos,bikewale,25-08-2018
The dominar -still worth buying it in 2018 ,"Well.... I bought the dominar 400 at popular bajaj in bangalore.  I bought the 2018 red variant dominar at on road price of 206000. It has been great pleasure riding it till now (2000kms) It has an aggressive look,  excellent complete led headlamps,  quite a lot powerful 35 horse power triple spark and most refined single cylinder dts-i engine . Service at present is not the best ....Needs Time for better services and availability of spares.  This bike performs  a lot better when compared to re 350,500,himalayan, duke250, 200 and also the direct competitor mahindra mojo No perfect maintenance required  Service is mandatory for 1000 4000 8000 kms at base price after free service of 1300 bucks. The pros 1. Won't heat up like ktm 2.Comfortable and easy to commute 3.Made for long distance rides 4. Best in class abs 5. Best headlamps The cons 1. Low mileage as 25kmpl 2. No gear shift indicator 3.Higher rpm at lower gears 4. Little vibrations at high speed 5. Lower ground clearance.",4,pos,bikewale,25-08-2018
Eye-catching & iconic,Well firstly it's a very dominating bike in the market which came from the house of bajaj. Design looks amazing specially the canyon red looks stunning. Built quality could have been better. Very vibration then a re. Digital console is great. Brakes are awesome on that it has got a dual channel abs which gives a great confidence while riding on city roads. As the bike weighs about 182 kgs but the weight doesn't bother the rider while riding it seems to be light and handling is great. I just love how it rolls over the street.,5,pos,bikewale,25-08-2018
D400 the best abs ever,"Good experiences with bajaj regarding buying but in case of servicing there are a little bad experience but the bike doesn’t require any major repairs,you can trust the machine.The best thing is abs , i think it’s the best abs ever you can feel the performance of abs installed on dominar. Then the powerful headlamp will support you on night ride.",5,pos,bikewale,25-08-2018

Dominar 400 a legend in making!,I checked lot of reviews and narrowed down to ktm390 and dominar 400. Later on i decided to buy dominar 400. As it suits my needs. I have been using this bike for 5 months and i am very impressed with its performance and highway stability. I get an average of 25kmpl in city and 32kmpl on highways and i got a top speed of 162kmph. I drool over the bike's looks. Hats off bajaj for making this awesome bike.,5,pos,bikewale,25-07-2018

The perfect tourer,"Its my hyper machine.The bike is excellent from bajaj an its way better than pulsar series in terms of power, ride quality ,build quality etc.The bike is excellent for long rides and its a pocket rocket in highways . My bike gives an avg of 30 kmpl in daily commuting and it gives 33.5 kmpl in long highway rides . The service cost is same as the duke 390. The stability at high speed of the bike is awesome way better than d390 because of its weight .The slipper clutch is best in its class and the braking is also good . If we use better brake pads other than the bajaj giving it will be far better . The main attraction point is its headlights.Visibility in night is very good . Handling of the bike is so easy in while riding but in stance the bike is little difficult because of its 183 kg of weight. Its the only bike giving these much features at a price point of rupees 1.83 lakhs approx on road. Its the best value for money bike . I just rode 28k km in my bike in 1.3 years it has been a wonderful journey till here. There no such complaints occur to my bike till here. They had built a perfect mid-range touring bike .The service center peoples are very helpful and they solve any problems with the bikes . The bike feel rough if there is no lubrication the chain. Lube the chain always for a better ride. The light is some difficult in foggy or rainy conditions. The bike performs awesome in Indian conditions . 0 to 100 in just a breeze . Tripple digit numbers will come so comfortably . The exhaust will rub into the road when in deep corners.",4,pos,bikewale,25-07-2018
Best possible investment in my life,"An awesome experience everyday i ride this bike. Just dominates the road in every condition,be it rain,mud roads,speed breakers anything ...It's an easy to drive this bike.Powerful engine: the pickup is very good,in city and in highways for close overtakes.No vibration till 7k rpm. Touching a speed of 160 is very easy and the bike has immense control due to it's weight. The duke although has more pick up does not have the road grip dominar has.Service : good network of service centres and a desi brand to keep the costs low always.Satisfied with the product so far.The engine and major spare parts are those of ktms. So you get quality at a lower price and lower cost of maintenance.The engine although oil cooled heats up while driving in traffic in low gears.The head light is amazing, probably the best in India. Night ride is a no problem in this bike , sharp turns will be a challenge cause of the vertical light position.Would recommend this bike than re which has a huge maintenance cost.Remember ""plastic is better than rust'",5,pos,bikewale,25-07-2018

And, one that bajaj claim will re-energise the motorcycling market in India much the same way the pulsars did 16 years ago.

And front wheel shockers are little tight which you may feel in upper arm during off road driving.Safe riding and happy biking..",4,pos,bikewale,25-05-2018
A biased review. ,"Buying experience: worst. At khivraj motors. My friend had bought a ktm 250 few days back. Showroom took photos. Gifted the key along with accessories(helmet, bike cover, key chain, probiker gloves, etc). For dominar they didn't even take a photo. I had to collect it from parking lot upstairs. 0 accessories as well. Not happy at all Riding experience: i used to drive activa. And dominar felt very heavy initially. But now when i drive activa it feels like i am driving a bicycle. I needed some time to get used to weight. I use it for short trips as well as long ones. Bangalore to mumbai. Mumbai to goa. Mumbai to alibagh, pune, daman, etc. Never has the bike failed to amaze me with its performance and i really feel safe when driving it. Usually i stick between 80-110 range. One flick of the accelerator and speed is in triple digits and when u want to stop i trust the braking as well. Abs saved my ass once or twice. Car door opened without warning once and bike stopped in very short distance. Dog crossing road, saved there as well when i was in 80+Looks: awesome. But i like ktm's logo on rim. I did get it done similar for dominar outside. I have the white one. It looks really pretty. Performance - very good. Loved it. Trust it. Servicing - mixed feelings. Serviced at raj bajaj vashi. It was very bad. It depends on service center. Note:Researched a lot before buying - i needed power, long range between refuel, abs. Mojo has best exhaust note in this range. Only bike that beats dominar in this range is duke 350 has better power, instrument cluster, lighter but 1lakh costlier and i don't feel it's worth that. Benelli is very costly. Enfield cannot be considered. Dominate fulfilled all criteria. I get 35+ average from day 1 and with 13l fuel tank i get a range of 350+ km. Abs. 2 lakh on road bangalore. Not too cheap but not too over the top. Pros:Range of 350km + on full tank Fantastic power Abs Cons:Showrooms need to treat their customers better. Service centers need to improve as well Bike can be a little bit lighter. For me its ok. But it will be easier to drive by most people. Rubber grips on handle bar can be better.",5,pos,bikewale,25-05-2018
Beast with beauty,"No doubt it,s beast with matchless simple beauty .Good power with great  handling.

In terms of riding experience its good, but while in traffic the footrest tend bug you if you are of shorter height. The looks of of the bike are spot on. The performance till 4500 kms is good as well. Goes from 0-100 quickly and easily. Personally i have not rode it for more than 110kmph, but has muscle to go. Braking is good, dual channel abs. After sale service is good from bajaj. Pros:  cost, performance, looks Cons: digital display, and mud guards.If you want to have a fast daily commute bike dominar is for you. Don't expect this to have good mileage, amazing riding experience and best in class. But at this cost, its the best.If you have money go for ktm 390 else d400 is the one for you.",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Dominar beast on the road ,1.Starting with the looks it's a beast on the road beautiful design 2.Riding oh god i am enjoying every second of it the roar it generates make me feel like i am on the race track 3.All the parts are of high quality hats off to bajaj they have not compromised with tiny screw's an nuts.4.Overall the bike is a monster.,5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Gorgeous bike ever seen,Gorgeous bike ever seen It's buying experience is good i got it in 20 days Riding experience also good when we travel no pain on the back bones it's it's peculiarity It look is gorgeous and it's abs braking system and it's performance is very very good It's servicing is more thankfully because it's servicing is more easy.,5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
A very practical bike it is.,"When i have a budget of 2 lakh. Then i just confused in many of bike stand in market. Like mahindra mojo, um bikes, apache 310 rr also and dominar, himalayan, and ktm rc 200. Then i think about my uses, where i daily used this bike. I just take test drive of each of them. In all of them i stuck on rc 200 apache 310 rr and dominar. I found dominar easier from both of them. More practical, handing is awesome, then i come to budget. Dominar is more affordable in compare to rc and apache. Then i just bought it and took its to my home. Its very practical bike.",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Value For money...!!,"Buying experience was good. I bought from kochi. 1st service done after 500 kms. It costs about 1200rs something. Now I crossed 3k kms,still I didn't face any problems yet. overall riding experience is good on both highway and city rides. On highway, I got 30-35km of mileage. And braking is awesome. But in the case of rear, it should improve. The other nice feature is slipper clutch, its work very well in high speeds. Overall value for money guys. No other bikes gives this much of features and safety on this money. Go ahead.",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Dominates the night,"Looks of the bike is amazing and it really dominates the night. The performance of the this bike is amazing and considering the fact the it's good for going for long rides and having an outstanding performance in both terrains which i have covered.Cons:- in city limits the performance decreases, the person sits in the back experiences a small vibration in the foot rest.Pros:- good seating position, comfortable ride.Servicing:- quite good, expertise in the panel are less and should consider giving it in the service centre itself.",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Amazing in price range ,First of all this bike is very cost effective. And the ride position is very comfortable for long touring. And the aerodynamic design of domination is amazing. After sales service is not as good compare to other. Bajaj should work on their service centres. The fuel efficiency is very good. The main con of this bike is after sales service.,5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018

Dominar a beast unlocked,The bike looks great and one can ride it on road and off road easily i myself have a great experience of this bike.

Good power, better control, best braking system, and excellent performance. If you have budget, blindly go for. My personal opinion.",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Feel the ABS,"Dual channel ABS is the best part...Just Feel the ABS...Slipper clutch adds an extra advantage.....Very decent price for a bike like this......
You won't feel any vibration even after 120kmph.... Maintenance cost is high(a single indicator costs you 650INR)....Mileage is acceptable for a 372cc vehicle(25-28Kmpl).",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
i am not a bajaj fan but the dominar is incredible,"in performance wise this bike is much better than   other bikes under 2 lakh segment. I have did a top speed of 164, there is no other machine in 2 lakh segment which have 35 bhp ,abs, slipper clutch, service centers are not much  better when compared to KTM.  they won't care about delivery time

Review,"1- buying experience was nice , i was too excited to buy this bike and it worth to buy.2- riding experience is more smooth as i expected , proud to own this kind of bike.3- i love this bike look , even some time i felt that i had love at first sight with this bike , i have no complain about performance it's more than my expectation.4-no issue with servicing , i used to take my bike time to time for servicing , in respect to maintenance you need loose little bit more when i compare maintenance cost to my previous bike.Pros-1- nice bike , solid body and worth to buy because no one offering with in this amount .2- performing at any situation and specially in hilly areas.3- tyres are good even you feel the grip. Cons- only mileage is lesser the described by manufacturer.Note- worth to buy.",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Tough make in Indian machine,"One who wants a bike for regular use and long tours, can buy this bike eyes closed. Bajaj has started selling the bike as abs standard now. Everything is good worth paying for on this machine. The sweet 375cc engine is more then enough for long highway runs on a constant speed above 100km/h . With least amount of vibes from the engine. In city rides foot-pegs position can be a little trouble for shatter riders as foot-pegs comes right in the middle. Abs works good but if you observe well on regular basis both front and back disks tends to get heated. Service cost is minimum. Saddlebag holders, larger windscreen, all other small mods are available as after market purchase for upgrade.",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Best bike,"I own  abs version of bajaj dominar, this was my second bike. It gives easy and full control over the machine. The design of the bike is also very nice and will give 5/5 for it. Despite the 182kg weight, the dominar 400 doesn’t feel lazy at low speeds either.If riding more than 100kmph, the handle shakes a bit. But overall i would rate 4/5.",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Riding the wind,"When i went to the showroom near by searching for a new bike i saw this beauty which i just couldn't resist. I took a test drive at fell in love with it right away. Riding this bike felt like riding the wind it was so smooth, sturdy and fast. I felt it's power running through my veins. The ride was so delightful, pleasing and thrilling that i had it right away.  This bike is a beauty for me its cool chassis and that beautiful mask sends me in the state of an orgasm. The performance is top class. I've been using it for a year or so but i still love  it i usually get bored of new bikes soon but this one caught my attention and it still has it. For me its an awesome  ride that gives you the feel of a top class naked. And has no cons accept some servicing one's.  From my side it's a go for it.",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
More feature and power in less money,"Bike is smooth and the sitting is comfortable for long rides. And power is amazing .

All you get a beautiful package in a budget......I just love this bike.",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Bajaj dominar 400 all the way!!,"Bajaj dominar 400. We all know somewhere about this bike, it is by far the best 'value for money' bike that has entered the Indian market. Dominar gives you the power of a 400 cc engine, abs brakes for the safety of the rider, great handling around the corners, great mileage and headlights that rule the night. Also,the after sales maintenance is pretty low and all in all a truly dependable bike for the short joyrides and also the long journeys. Few downsides being quite a big bike, heavy at times (not once you start rolling the wheels), and minor cost cuttings here and there which don't really stand as any deal breaker. I do not own a dominar 400 but have heard a lot of feedback from my friends who own it and watched literally thousands of reviews as its my favorite bike and dream is to have it one day. This was some info i wanted to share about the bike and hopefully will help the buyers to make better choices. Cheers to bajaj for producing this amazing bike.",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Dominar 400 true love exposed,1.I am proud buyer of dominar 400 and i feel the luxury of it when other bikers or strangers ask something good about the bike and speak some good about it.2.Best mileage at best pricing parallel best powered cruiser ever seen. All performance on both off road and smooth roads is awesome. 3.Best part comes is that it has ultimate looks and i have added knuckle guards which increases its beauty still more and the big sexy tyres which matches perfectly to the size of the bike.4.Actually we won't feel the servicing costs as it is serviced for 4000kms and maintenance is the it gives a mileage of 25kmpl at city limits and 30kmpl at outskirts i.E. At highways.5 the pros of this bike is that it has a styled look and best power i.E. 35bhp at a cheaper rate i.E. Inr 1.94 lakh. The con is that bike is heavier compared to other bikes at this segments .,5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018

Best ever from bajaj,"It was pleasant experience from mayur bajaj, dehradun. Bike got delivered on the same day! first it seemed like quite heavy bike, i am 5.85 so height was not a problem at all. Throttle response in first gear was low but when i shifted to higher gears it was superb and calm. Headlights are just flawless. Abs works like charm and breaks are really good but changed the brake shoes because stock break shoe's response was not quite well. Looks macho and has the big bike feeling in it.Servicing was nice experience as bajaj has set up separate bay for dominar and not that much of problem at all. Costs around 1500 for servicing.Build quality is way higher than the bajaj standard. But cant compare it with big names like kawasaki, yamaha, honda etc.Pros:Big bike Mileage Looks Headlights Breaks Suspensions Liquid cooling.Cons:Brake shoes Plastic tank Otherwise i am in love with this bike!",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Dominar,1. The bike is best for this price.2. Ultimate experience for a long ride.3. My bike colour is red and black. The look is awesome and superb colour code.4.

Worthy to be 400,"The dominar handles with a confidence and eagerness that belies its power cruiser tag and heft kerb weight. The motorcycle is willing to change direction without having to fight the handlebars. Stability is good when leaned over even if the bike encounters some unexpected bumps. Bajaj also took a good decision of positioning the footpegs slightly rear-set instead of the traditional forward stance on a cruiser. This makes it easier to stand on the pegs on broken roads and also liberates a good amount of cornering clearance. The inclusion of a slipper clutch is a nice bonus that smooths out aggressive downshifts.we can't wait to experience this bike and we are sure you are waiting for the same. However, do remember to read our first drive review, which you'll find here soon, of the bike before you visit the dealership to get a better idea about the dominar 400.",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Precious things are always neglected,No one knows what's India holds for a precious diamond are found just v have an eye to recognise....Bajaj always discovers a legends. Bajaj dominar 400 a born legendary two wheeler in all aspects.No words to prescribe to others that about this bike.1. Lowest price level.2. Comfortable ride on local streets as well as high ways.3. Dynamic looks and unbeatable performance.4. Lowest servicing and maintenance.5. Just go for it.,5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Queen,"Performance is great even though i tried to ride rough . Abs is very effective, balance also good. Sometimes it is vibrating but i had pulsar so i used to it. I miss engine sound and gear indicator in it. You can not expect 60kmpl with 373cc engine. So 30kmpl for me is ok. Till date i didn't find any major service related issue .",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Tiger on road,"The bajaj dominar was bought at an inr of rs. 1,89,850 (bangalore). *a smart looking power cruiser , that gives a big bike feel!*good ride quality and handling balance along with 157mm of ground clearance, which helps pass big-ish speed bumps and rough (or no) roads .*feature loaded.

A powerful companion which never let you down no matter what!,"Dominar 400 is one great motorbike considering the price to product ratio. The bike has its own set of pros and cons like all other bikes but i would like to elaborate them for users to decide for themselves what they choose to drive.Pro:>price tag: the price of the bike is very aggressive considering the fact that it comes with all the latest electronics and safety features. >handling: the handlebar is constructed in such a manner that you never want to pause your journeys during long trips. Very comfortable and easy to handle manoeuvres.>power: this is the segment where the bike excels. That huge torque at low rpm(torque starts to kicks in at 3.5k-4k rpm) makes you overtake on highways without a struggle. Hitting 100kmph mark has never been this easy and can cruse at 100-120 at just 4k rpm at 6th gear.>mileage: i know many are considered about this section. We all know that bajaj does care about mileage more as they have studied about Indians and so that applies to this bike even. On a trip covering 250kms, i was given a very decent mileage of 32kmpl considering the fact that i was cruising at 100kmph>suspension: this bike does a very good justice for the tagline #go hyper riding as the suspension is very good enough to ride even on bad roads. During my trip, i had to cover some very bad roads which were taken very easily by dominar. No wonder, in this department this bike excels.>braking: this is the department where i felt the bike lacks a bit. The bite is not strong enough to stop this mighty bike at that mark. I don't know how abs on this will work as mine is a non abs variant. But on riding ktm rc200 and dominar side by side i felt this bike lacks that bite to stop the bike on mark.>slipper clutch: yeah!! a feature which is quite new to be considered. This bike comes equipped with the slipper clutch and its only good and helpful if one knows how to make complete use of it. It took me a while to master this feature. But only useful if one is riding at good speeds. But kudos bajaj to introduce this tech for a daily commuter bike.>headlight and console: headlight is one hell of a thing in dominar. It looks like a premium bike which is heading your way. The console is somewhat less informative as i have felt.  Cons:>vibrations: yes, there are vibrations which irritates you a lot. I would seriously tell bajaj to stop making fun of re and work on this department asap. They exist as soon you cross 5k rpm and they are so bad that one cannot see who is approaching from behind from rare view mirrors(same like re).>brakes: as i have mentioned already, they lack the bite to stop the bike on that mark.But considering the power, safety, all latest technologies and other rivals in the market i would definitely say that dominar is a steal for the price and if someone who is planning to go buy a bike at this price point, i would say them to test drive dominar once and then reconsider their purchase. The bike is very comfortable and good for daily commute and long drives/leisure drives.",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Most affordable beast in Indian market ,<p>This bike is actually a beast you must know how to tame it once you hop on to the saddle and switch on the ignition you feel the surge of power within the bike .This bike can be used by beginners also . And for the experienced ones this is the bike for you . But if you are thinking of mileage or daily commute then this bike may not be an option to you . But if you want to explore places or love riding then this is the bike and go for it!!</p>,4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018

Might dominar 400! ,"<p>A fantastic power cruiser & a value for money package. Bajaj d400 is single cylinder 373 cc liquid cool 4 stroke engine that pumps 37bhp and 35nm of torque and top speed of 163 kmhr.</p><p>It is a good bike and doesn't even heat up a wide dealership network of bajaj makes the owner to ride the bike hassle free in any part of country(India). The service cost is cheap but service experience is worst. Ride quality is good but not the best due to vibrations at handlebar after 4000 rpm. The brakes are excellent as dual channel abs are present, also slipper clutch is awesome giving maximum engine breaking & the last thing is the headlights are awesome as they are full led. I just wish if the bike had gear indicator and could have a more power output. Also the tank is 13 litres( 1.5 litres reserved).</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Bajaj's best gamble yet! d400 - the beast,"<p>I bought this after detailed review from powerdrift. But i waited long for the arrival of matte black colour and I've never been more happy. This bike in its price bracket is a beast!  i use it for daily commute and occasional long rides and it never disappoints me. I can ride 150-250km in a single full tank with no sign of fatigue. Sitting posture is upright and there's absolutely no weight to be felt at wrist and hands. Bike usually in city condition will give out maximum of 23-25kmpl and on highways it could reach 27-30kmpl but mileage is not an issue after-all. Looks are absolutely head turner and not one person you meet will ever stop to ask about price and availability of this. Servicing costs around 1100 if you get bajaj's 10,000 engine oil. I prefer motul 10w50 so it jumps around 2500-3000/ service. Only cons i can feel till now is vibration and jarring sound you notice at smaller revs and mirror vibrations all the way up after 4000 rpm. Rest i can say that this bike is an absolute killer both for money and tech it carries.</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018

The underdog,"<p>Bikes were not a passion for me, for me they were only a way of transportation until i got introduced to the dominar 400. I used to ride a unicorn 150 and this sure was a huge step up.</p><p>Performance</p><p>The heart of bike is where the adrenalin begins as it is tuned like a fighter jet. The 373.3 cc engine derived from duke 390 is tuned for about 35 b.H.P. Of power and a blistering 35 n.M. Of torque. The engine could be a little bit more refined and the power delivery a bit more linear. </p><p>Fuel consumption</p><p>The mileage that i got in city was around 22 and it had reached all the way up to 35 on a highway.</p><p>Comfort</p><p>The bike feels planted at the corners and at high speeds but the suspension is a bit stiff for Indian roads and you do feel each and every bump. The seat is soft and big enough but the pillion seat does feel a bit small and is suitable only for shorter rides. The vibrations on the foot-pegs are well controlled but the tank vibrates a bit.</p><p>Buying experience</p><p>The buying experience was good overall but the delivery could have been a bit better for such a premium bike.</p><p>Looks </p><p>This bike is an absolute looker for its price and it looks absolutely breathtaking from any angle you could possibly imagined. Though the tail lights could have been a bit different. The led headlights are an absolute delight to use.</p><p>Maintenance</p><p>The first service was at 700 k.M. And then after every 5000 k.M. . The chain should be lubed at every 500 k.M. And the service costs are low. Being a bajaj the cost of spares is also very less.</p><p>Problems </p><p>1. There is a common issue of the vibration of tank which can be easily solved by the service persons.</p><p>2. The rear break seems to be less effective and the abs kicks in very early.</p><p>3. The bike feels sluggish at slow speeds.</p><p>Overall the bike is a value for money offer and is great for upgrading from a smaller capacity bike.</p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Hathi mat paalo actually fits on whom,"<p>Buying experience: on road around 158k in lucknow and aiming at the re classic 350 which is the leader in the segment in terms of sales per year.Re may not be as agile as the dominar but it has a charismatic perception in the masses since decades, since generations.</p><p>But the dominar can not be overlooked for sure because of its macho looks, and a very powerful engine producing 35 newton-meter of torque @ 6500rpm. Amazing isnt it? giving the 6th gear made it very special for the power lovers and an easy transmission of gears makes it soothing for the sports bike lovers. And actually it serves all the purposes like daily commute or cruise or adventure or whatever.</p><p>Fuel capacity is 13l and gives u an average of around 30 on freeways while in city it all depends on how u handle the beast. Its a heavy bike which makes you stable even at the higher speed which will reach at maximum of 140 kmph+ and  no vibrations till 110 kmph as per my experience. Double disc brakes will ease you life even in the hell. Liquid cooling will provide an edge over the airc ooled engines in terms of performance and the special 3 sparked, fuel injected features makes it more reliable performer of the segment where actually no other exists except the one and the only royal enfield...Lets ignore the pros and cons for sometime.  </p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Mighty machine ,"<p>Superb bike under this price tag because you won't get any other under rs. 2 lakhs , go for it without any second thought as it has both, the muscular look & the power like a beast with great comport for long trips. I was a re fan from childhood & wanted to go for royal enfield classic 350 or thunderbird but after riding this bike after one of my friend got it soon after the launch i became a fan of this best beauty by bajaj till date.</p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Dominar non abs,"<p>I bought the beast in october matte black non abs, bike is great in terms of pick up and smooth engine and bike' s  heavy weight gives stability in high speed and i got the millage around 27 totally satisfied about the bike, brakes are good in spite of non abs only negative is gearbox because gear shifting is hard in up shifting if you looking for a bike around 1.5 lakes go for it. </p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Good buy and great performance,"<p>The buying experience is not that great the showroom and sales rep are not responsive at one point i had dropped the plan of buying. The bike has great seating posture the riding comfort is great. For city and even for the long ride, i have done 11k in one ride, i never had any pain in butt nor in back. Bike is very responsive and breaking is great, the control in the turning is also great, the vibration at 110kmph is very less, you can ride the bike comfortably at 120-130kmph constantly. The looks are good. Bajaj service is not that great ok kind of thing. The maintenance cost is less compared to other bikes in this range. I have done already 5 services of the bike. My total ride experience on this bike is around 20k km. This might be as great as yamaha r3 or ktm 390 but still a good buy at the cost bajaj is offering and considering the maintenance cost and interval.</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
2018 best bike ,"<p>Best bike of the year the dominar 400’s engine has been extensively revised and you can see that in the numbers. The single-cylinder motor delivers 35ps at 8,000rpm and 35nm at 6,500rpm of peak torque the standout feature of the dominar 400 is the all-led headlight the led unit provides brilliant luminance while the light spread is also impressive </p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Go hyper riding,"<p>1. Buying experience.. Well the cost is the killer part here. Bajaj has done  really a good job at pricing of the bike. It was a good experience at the showroom.</p><p>2. Riding experience.. Amazing.. It's totally different world on the bike. Hyper riding ;)</p><p>3. Looks.. Well it's okay for a cruiser and it's quiet comfortable for long rides. And coming to the performance, it's fantastic and the liner power delivery is great and smooth.</p><p>4. Servicing and maintenance isn't that bad</p><p>5. Pros- awesome led lights, looks good, beasty sound, pickup, comfort for both rider and pillion, great handling.</p><p>Cons- not much except for heavy weight. It doesn't matter much except in traffics.</p><p>Overall a decent bike for the price! :)</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018

Truth about bajaj dominar ,"<p>Truth about dominar my cousin own the dominar 400 just recently he has purchased it the bike is awesome with cool looks everybody bow there head down towards dominar to take a look .Its like a silent killer because you will never complaint about power,comfort and mileage. Within 10/15 seconds you can easily reach 100kmph and it can take any drag race at any time no matter which bike is opponent and coming towards the comfort it awesome you will never get back pain at any cost and talk about the mileage it's giving around 30/35kmpl depends upon your driving.Main importantly you have the safety feature like abs which is much needed for this bike.If bike lovers want power and performance then they can go for the bike because like bajaj said ""size is nothing without performance"" </p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Why i bought this over re classic 350,"<p>First of all, let me state that i have used a royal enfield classic 350 for 4+ years and this buying this bike has been a worthwhile upgrade. </p><p>Buying experience: was smooth and took delivery 1 day after i made the complete payment. </p><p>Riding experience: this bike is very humble in terms of its single cylinder engine note. It gets loud and grunty as you raise the rpm north of 4k. One cool feature i'd like to point out is the bike will crawl at a speed of 10 km/h in 1st gear (after gradually releasing the clutch) and it becomes really useful traffic as you don't have to operate both clutch and brake levers on congested roads. (additionally the weight of the bike is not felt when moving and helps to maneuver when aggressive car drivers try to reduce your clearance space in traffic) this crawling feature also allows one to climb bumpy ghat roads slowly and with complete control. On the highway, the bike is absolutely smooth and the buttery feel got better after consecutive servicing (oil changes). I will mention however, i am no speed demon on the highway. I prefer cruising below 100kmph and did realise that a windshield becomes very very important if one were to sustain triple digit speeds on good roads. Personally felt that windshields ruin the visual appeal of the bike by disrupting its 'lion' stance from head to tail. Speaking of looks while white seems to be the most common colour and you could never go wrong, i just wish bajaj didn't drop the ball by 4 colours in total out of which 2 don't offer much road presence when the bike is moving. Speaking of road presence, this bike got many head turns in traffic in day time due to its wide rear tire, heavy large bike bike feel and also at night due to its absolutely spectacular headlamps. I am personally not a big fan of the 'shape' of the tail lamps however, and felt a single unit led type would make it stand out more among the pulsars. Up close however, you can quickly realise that this is not pulsar tail lamp because the light projects (via led) in a very sophisticated manner. Its quite intriguing. In the braking department, the abs system works as advertised however i do feel that the rear brake could use a bit more bite. Servicing, i take the bike to a ktm/bajaj service centre and they always do a good job. Please check the ratings before visiting your nearest service centre. Spare a half of your weekend day for service before hand and go the extra distance to find a decent service centre if you truly love your machine. Maintenance wise, i always wipe down my bike every night before using the bike cover to keep it from getting dusty. I wash it twice a week, clean the tire side walls and black parts with polish and lube the chain every 500km. I know some may say that its overkill but i like my bike to be flawlessly clean and glimmering in its white paint. </p><p>Pros: if your thinking of replacing your re, this has got to be one of your main contenders because it has everything. Its fast. Its all led. Its all digital. Its very powerful. Its feature packed (slipper clutch, abs), its comfortable. It turns heads. It stands out. Its a big bike. It looks like a lion. </p><p>Cons: the bike does vibrate and something you hear vibration-like noises coming from somewhere on the upper body of the bike. There are two ways you can go about this. One option is to panic, go to any local mechanic to completely disassembly the fuel tank and have them add rubber padding everywhere to dampen the noise. Or be like me and accept that it does vibrate and be mature and choose to not let it annoy you. This sound can vary from bike to bike and mine is not that bad. I don't mind it and i have grown to look beyond it. Real attention should be given to things that affect performance or looks and this vibration craziness is not one on that list. </p><p>Overall, there is not one day, i don't look at this bike from any angle and regret switching over from re. Its very appealing bike and its put in a affordable and feature adequate package. </p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Dominating 400,"<p>I get my bike from showroom just after 2 day and their is no complications between paperwork, no complications between servicing.</p><p>Bike is super smooth in running even where you are in market or tour and exhaust sound is superb,i really love this bike.</p><p>Servicing cost is very low as compared to other 400cc bikes as available in market.</p><p>So at the last i say...If dominar is your first bike then grab it..</p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018

Review,"<p>The design and styling is largely similar to the cs400 concept with some key additions made to the cruiser. It has a sculpted body and an aggressive stance that gives it a muscular look. Equipped with the led headlamp in front, it is the first model from bajaj to get that. The muscular fuel tank, broad handlebars and well-designed engine cowl completes the brawny look. One of the other firsts on the bike includes the all-digital lcd instrument cluster that provides all the necessary information required by the rider. </p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
All explanation about bajaj dominar 400cc,"<p>I love this bike when it come in market because it is reasonable price and  bajaj gives 400cc so much fast and with abs braking system and this bike also looks very beautiful then others new look and design and the bajaj gives me three services free which is very cool and the bike maintenance is very easy condition of bike is so much good like new, recently came from showroom </p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Dominar  the touring beast,"<p>I am a long distance riding enthusiast and been riding classic 350 for over 3 years. While royal enfields are great bikes for touring, I've always been disappointed about the fact that so much technology was missing in the ride. When ever i was riding my classic i would wish it had more power, more agility, more stuck to the road, that it had great breaking etc. So, I've already had a picture and feel of how my imaginary bike would be and then i rode the dominar once which my friend had bought, this ride was a little over 40 kms and i fell in love with it. I bought the bike myself while retaining the classic as well (since it's my childhood dream to own a royal enfield). I've completed a 3000 kms expedition recently and man this bike can take you to any place like a cake walk. There is a lot of juice left in dominar that i'm waiting to experience and pretty excited about the next ride on this bike (never get bored).</p><p>I hope bajaj continues to launch bigger versions of the dominar. I will not hesitate to buy them all :)</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
The power cruiser beast!!!!!,<p>Buying experience: awesome..I love this bike best power cruiser. </p><p>Riding experience: no back pain very comfortable.</p><p>Awesome performance.

But no noise while riding.. </p><p>Overall its nice and good.. Worth for the money.</p>,5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Best bike in bajaj,"<p>First i am very happy to ride this bike it's my dream to drive bike like this. I have gone through many reviews and have done research on this bike. I prefer to buy abs bike because it is very safe for the riders. Price also differ in bike with and without abs. Engine is smooth, as driving is also very smooth. Look is very cool as i am riding a lion , i feel like that. And this bike also designed by taking the structure of a lion. Finally this is the good option for riders who wants to go for a tours and riding long distances. Thanks for giving this opportunity. </p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018

Review,<p>An awesome time since owned dominar...</p><p>Feeling heavenly loved. Never thought that it can be such a nice. Its really dreams come true.

About some power,"<p>First of all when i went to showroom for purchasing it, i was little bit confused. But after purchasing it i felt that i had done good. It's look is gorgeous and it is amazing too. And the main thing is that it is comfortable and has very good mileage. And as every vehicle it also need servicing but that is common too. I just want to say that to all the users that if you are in any confusion regarding it..... Just forget it.  </p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Really awesome!!!! worth every penny you pay for it,"<p>I bought the bike from popular bajaj. Starting with delivery, the service was crisp and clear, not what you expect from a typical bajaj product being serviced. They say dominar is their flagship, you feel how it is. Indeed! </p><p>I really loved the product, which is why i got this. Really worth every penny than what you pay for the mojo or the enfields. The ad clearly proves that, but should have been a bit more respectful for an enfield, for they are not something to be let down. Riding comfort is supreme, and so is the throttle response. One especial feature is the headlight. You can even shut down frantic cars with the mini-sun upfront the dominar. Service costs is far less from what you expect from a premium bike. In all it is a great bike, and long term reliability is really a question, particularly when it comes to bajaj. Else i would have gone for a 5/5 stars. </p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
It's your dominar,"<p>Dominar 400 is look like a big animal. So fast and perfect for race sports. Service and maintenance are important to all bikes. So servicing and maintenance take time to time then your bike will give you full life time. Friends don't use other engine oil please. Always use one oil.  I care my bike, it's dominar.</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018

The things i love about dominar is its performance you will never feel out of the power at any condition any road it will always supports you on every riding condition. The 2nd thing is super bright led. It is best in class bike.  It gives bike aggressive look at night. </p><p>Slipper clutch best and first in it's class it gives you ultimate bike experience. </p><p>Cons </p><p>The front suspension is little stiff. </p><p>Fuel tank capacity is less</p>,5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018

Dominar 400 - a companion for almost a year now...,"<p>In order to start with the buying experience, i will have to tell you how confused i was among all the ruling street leaders like mahindra mojo, ktm duke, royal enfield and the most expected exotic looking tvs rtr 310(erstwhile akula) which were stopping me from deciding which are my set of wheels. Although i am a bit of aggressive rider, i do prefer a bike that supports me while touring/long rides as well. Just for the point mentioned in my last line, mahindra mojo was my first obvious pick for it's unique design, touring ergonomics and a humongous 21 liter fuel tank. </p><p>That's when i saw a picture of the earlier announced tvs akula which caught my eyes like a kid who had just seen a bunch of colorful candies on a bakery shelf. This stopped me from booking a mojo and kept me waiting to get my hands on it to see if that was my toruk (an avatar character)! </p><p>But then with all the excitement i had packed for that bike, the feeling started depleting as the dates were only getting pushed ahead. That's when pulsar rs 200 came to my mind and i took a test ride. Although i liked the bike and it's amazing response i was blessed to have the sales manager(who also happened to be a pro biker) understanding my language of bikes and give him a call after 3 days without miss. </p><p>Agreeing to this i called him on Dec 15th 2016 and that's when he told me i need to visit them the next day to take the test ride of the newly launched, all new dominar 400. Oh goodness! the bike was stunning to look at and seemed like it was built to go head-on against a wrecking ball. My first ride stole me at turning on ignition which ignited those head lamps and that first rev bomb!  believe me when i say i logged on to the showroom computer and book the bike online immediately immediately after my ride.</p><p>From then probably the next 32 days were most anxious wait time for me until i took the delivery on January 18th 2017.  I was handed over the key of my new bike with the ultimate gesture by the most amazing staff of r.V bajaj, bengaluru. Thanks to them! my points for the team is 4 out of 5. </p><p>Riding experience has been north of awesome for me since i bought this bike. I guess crossing 16,000 kms on odo says it all. Although the riding experience has been beyond good for me, the bike does come with a few setbacks which i will point out in a bit. My points for riding experience will be about 4 out of 5.</p><p>When it comes to looks i reckon dominar steals the limelight from all it's competition in the segment of naked street/roadster/cruiser within the single cylinder arena and it still stands out against benelli 300 to a larger extent. Well built body kit, amazing styling, wide mrf rubber for tarmac, multi-layered leds on headlamps/tail lamps, beautiful looking two piece instrument cluster, trustworthy abs assembly are literally mouth watering treat for someone like me!!</p><p>Performance has been excellent for a 400cc single cylinder power cruiser. While the motor has been derived from  ktm duke 390, it has been detuned for a better linear power to ensure that it delivers it's purpose of being called a power cruiser. But then as always there have been questions from the buyers as to why isn't it as fast as duke even though it's the same engine? well there are pros and cons to it, which i will talk in a bit.  My points of looks and performance blended will be 4 out of 5.</p><p>Servicing has played a major concern for a lot of us dominar owners as we still feel that every time the bikes goes for servicing, it comes back with very less satisfactory experience because i strongly feel that the service personnel are still not very well trained or equipped to service this piece of machine. This is a concern that has been raised to bajaj many times and there has been very little traction on it is what i personally feel. While the maintenance cost seems to be decently priced, the servicing is what most of us are still searching for to ensure the bike performs to it's potential without having to visit service center often for repairs or changes.  My points for this will about 3 out of 5. </p><p>I have covered most of the pros/cons in my points above. To point a few just take a peek below. Pros vs cons</p><p>1. A head turner styling and color schemes - missing the windshield which brings a lot wind-blast on high speed runs.</p><p>2. Decent fuel economy  - a very small fuel bucket for a cruiser. </p><p>3. Decent linear power while riding - still loses a lot of earlier pickup because of power-weight ratio. 183 kgs is a lot of weight which is the reason why there's no sudden outburst of power like a ktm.</p><p>4. The most powerful stock headlamps - only works in a narrow straight line and can miss your turns during high speeds, which can be sorted by installing a pair of auxies. </p><p>5. Very good pair of mrf tyres which respond really well even at full speed - loses traction on lose surface and can't trust during wet roads.</p><p>6. The best value for money bike - no point can beat this! :) </p><p>Hope these points help those who are looking to upgrade to dominar 400 which will not be a disappointment if we share similar taste. </p><p>Wish you all a happy riding. Cheers folks!!! :) :)</p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Experience is better than words   ,"<p>No more words to say that experience. I shifted from royal enfield 350 to bajaj dominar 400.Its looks-wise, the bajaj dominar 400 strikes a macho pose with its front-biased muscular looks, complemented by a sculpted fuel tank.The friendly ergonomics are welcoming, be it the riding position or the flat wide handlebar and the comfortable split dual seat. And crawling through traffic, the dominar 400 doesn't make itself feel like a bulky motorcycle at all.</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018

Ownership review dominar 400,"<p>Hello friends,</p><p>This review is regarding most discussed powerful anticipated as sport cruising bike in entry segment, bajaj dominar 400 abs.</p><p>Buying bajaj is not a big task so skipping this segment. You can own a bajaj bike in no time all choices are present, like cash purchase, dedicated bajaj finance services as well as online payment mode.</p><p>I am riding this bike for 7000km till now on daily commuting, short group ride as well as little sporting purpose. Its smooth in all kind of rides but little weight issue while sporting.</p><p>On appearance side this bike give premium bike feeling in very economical range.</p><p>Bajaj maintenance is easy and cheaper, but this is major challenge to get good services for this bike. Bajaj launched this bike but technical experts for maintaining this bike is not well trained, as well as most of bajaj service centres are crowded with series of bike in range, which fail to provide premium services to most premium bike of bajaj till date, disappoint its user.</p><p>Pros</p><p>Value for money bike, has capability to cruise, but actually its not cruiser bike, powerful 400cc engine can do sports also but its not pure sports bike, its hybrid of sports bike as well as cruiser, you can't compare this will ktm's sporting spirited bike because of good weight or cruising capacity of re but this can do both up to a extent.</p><p>Best part which is shown is headlight is best in any class, purely fits on tag line, ""dominate the night""</p><p>Good family bike also, like other bike, pillion seat agronomy is not that comfortable like dominar.</p><p>Cons</p><p>This bike can be very good, seems launched in hurry, like secondary display could have been much better.</p><p>Abs is nice but should have options to off/on.</p><p>Spares unavailability in service centre is biggest disappointment after 10 month's of launching.</p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Outstanding experience with bajaj dominar 400,<p>What an bike never experienced like this one i used earlier apache and i exchanged with dominar it's really worth for money every one should experience you will not get demoralised .

Dominar is really dominating,"<p>1. I rode dominar for approx 200km and it is my friends bike though. I went with my friend when he went to buy it and bajaj behaves well with customers.</p><p>2. Ride quality is very  good whether you are a pillion or you are in riding position. The seat is very comfortable and the linear acceleration will be loved while you are on a highway. Off roading is also not bad on this bike i will rate it 3.5/5 on off roading. The mono suspension does the job perfect and the riding posture is very comfortable for touring.</p><p>3. Looks of the bajaj dominar is just amazing. If you come at night with your headlamps on highbeam everyone will think that a superbike is coming. The detailing done the bike design is awesome. The naked look suits this 400cc beast and everyone will surely turn their heads to watch the bike again when you are on dominar. The muscular looks is fit for naked bike lovers.</p><p>4. Bajaj needs to improve on their service quality. Everyone is complaining about the service quality of bajaj for dominar. Bajaj's service facilities are still not ready for a 400cc bike.</p><p>5. Pros- awesome looks,abs,10 led headlamp,comfort,cruising as well as power riding, the slipper clutch does a great job, the mileage is good enough for a 400cc bike</p><p>Cons- the tank should have been bigger for better touring,the abs switch is not there, the hazard switch should have been there,i feel that the bike's leg guards and tank pad which have been provided by domjnar is of no use at all</p><p>Overall bajaj has given us a fantastic flagship motor bike which is very pocket friendly as well as made for roads of India.</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018

Magnificent experience with abs....</p><p>If you are searching for mileage then it's very bad for you...</p>,4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Amazing dominar 400...,"<p>It's awesome experience.Best bike for long rides...No problem with this bike. Engine is awesome.Without a break i ride this for 9 hours..No back pain,no problem..I'm happy with this bike.And back sitters also not getting back pain and leg pain...I loved this.Suggesting everyone to buy this bike</p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Just drive this bike guys,<p>Grand look and i want to ride of all India by this bike non stop....I wish it'll possible as soon... Amazing bike and most thing is that this bike have 6 gear transmission system... Whenever i ride any 4 gear transmission bike then i feel it should be more gear transmission for more powerful speed..</p><p>Thanks</p>,5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Value for money,"<p>Style the bike undoubtedly has a very appealing naked look which i admire. The rear seat is slightly higher than normal bikes i what i inferred. The colors combinations that bajaj provides are very good but they could have given a little bit more of variety to choose from.</p><p>Engine performance, fuel economy and gearbox it is one the best acceleration performance I've seen in this section of bikes. Its quick, very quick. The fuel economy is slightly low. On road it gives me around 25 kmpl. The gearbox is quick and an amazing throttle response. The shifts are very quick. The exhaust is something that stands out. The exhaust sound is just amazing. You come to know its dominar passing by only because of the exhaust sound. Being a teenager its something i am fond of but elderly people don't like the loud sound of it.</p><p>Ride quality & handling the ride quality is much better compared to pulsar 200 ns. Though the lower gear vibrations is something that they can improve. The bike handles quite well and the turning is fine.</p><p>Final words overall the dominar is a very nice bike and a must buy. In case you plan to buy a pulsar 200 ns or rs200 my advise would be to go for the dominar  undoubtedly. You may have to spend more money but its something i found worth spending for.</p><p>Areas of improvement</p><p>1- lower gear body vibrations</p><p>2- maintenance cost</p><p>3- average</p><p>Pros</p><p>1- looks 2- acceleration 3- colors 4- throttle response</p><p>Cons</p><p>1- lower gear vibrations 2 - slightly high maintenance cost</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Bajaj is best for Indian costumers,<p>Nice big bike feel good mid range performance punchy engine abs is very good for this bike very stable on road overtaking in highway is easy on this bike weight should be 15/20 kg less in this bike make more fun i think so i have 2015 classic 350 and i notice that dominar is more comfortable in long rides </p>,5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Mr dominar,"<p>Excellent features & performance and good look.</p><p>Compact appearance all round with no space gap as of pulsar.</p><p>Colours of different may added for much attraction.</p><p>Attractive parking lights and light weight.</p><p>Easy handle and robust design</p><p>Cost and mileage feature may be rationalized.</p><p>All together well and good, both for city and local usual.</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
A nice and wonderful bike,"<p>Its a nice bike at this price just like a golden bike and if you want to buy this bike than do not think more  and buy it its grip, it's speed, power of engine everything is good nice look and wonderful headlight nice performance and and its average is nice at this price, it has also some backwards looking for price but overall it is a nice and wonderful bike</p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Dominar ownership review after 13k kms,"<p>I was really thrilled and was eagerly waiting for this bike since it first appeared as the cs400. Bought the bike finally in april and from then on the experience has been absolutely amazing.</p><p>I have done many long rides till date which have included some dream highways, some treacherous terrains, done some intense offroading, have ridden continuously in rain, at very low temperatures but this bike always refuses to budge down, it's always hungry for more. The mileage has been really good and bike is really comfortable for long rides. The riding experience of he dominar has been amazing.</p><p>Going to the looks, this bike is an absolute eye candy, always the center of attraction wherever it goes. The led head lamps are stunning and do the job superbly. The performance of this bike is really good and it makes me fall in love with this bike after every ride. The gear shifts are smooth, the slipper clutch works spot. Braking, the most important component on a bike for me works really really well, the braking in this bike is really good thanks to the dual channel abs which gives you tons of confidence whole riding.</p><p>The maintenance of this bike is really cheap and affordable. Servicing quality needs an upgrade but this issue matters city to city but the overall servicing needs an upgrade as this is bajaj's premium top end bike so it obviously deserves more.</p><p>The only drawbacks i feel in the bike is first of all the tail lights, bajaj should have come up with something better and more creative. Second, for a bike meant for touring, it should come equipped with hazard lights and a gear indicator.</p><p>The overall all package offered by the dominar is amazing and bang on worth the bucks. At this price mark, the featured included on this bike is really impressive. Bajaj has done some real hard work to come up with this wonder bike.</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Bajaj’s hayabusa dominar,<p>Great bike of till now of bajaj </p><p>The owner of showroom is very nice and personally sold us the newly launched dominar and gave a discount also</p><p>It looks great if you are long rider your video through your action camera if looks very nice </p><p>As i do in my videos</p><p>Its a sports bike it must be serviced after every 2 month or 2000 km which ever is earlier</p><p>If you are buying it for daily use then also you can buy </p><p>For motoring racing tour it also suit you</p>,5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Dominar 400,"<p>Too good to ride and excellent performance it goes fast than ktm duke 200. Dominar is good for braking system and head lights. I am glad to have this with me thanks bajaj company to bringing this awesome bike in Indian market bajaj all bikes are too good but our dominar 400 is wonderful, performance is good </p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Underrated bike ,"<p>Highly underrated bike</p><p>Great linear power, plenty of torque</p><p>Ideal for commuting and cruising </p><p>Good technology and features</p><p>Best in class headlight </p><p>Quite flick-able despite its weight </p><p>Can cruise at 120+ kmph without strain </p><p>My top speed 162 kmph </p><p>Amazing value for money </p><p>People ask about the bike at every signal and fuel pump</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Awesome bike ,"<p>Awesome bike really, i am really wondered after riding that bike because the pickup and beat was awesome and i totally like that bike and i m glad that i had owned that model and only thing is the look was not so good compared with rs but totally i'm satisfied i'm beating tnt 600cc bikes also and bullet 500cc.</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
My love affair with my beast,"<p>Owned my d400 for over 10 months now. Buying experience was as good as any other bajaj product, quick & easy. Done two services which set me back an average of rs.1300. I find the chassis very intuitive & stable for long highway runs. Gives you confidence on speeds excess of 130 kmph. There are few cons that i have experienced.</p><p>1: the stock tyres are not upto mark( this criticism maybe be because of me already used michelin pilot street on my fazer for three year). They don't do justice to the chassis.</p><p>2: pillion seat is a bit too flat, due to this, many times my pillions have experienced slippage when accelerating hard.</p><p>3: throttle response gets a bit jerky under 2.5k rpm in stop-go traffic.</p><p>4: the engine is a charm on highway, but doesn't like staying in traffic for longer duration.(by beast tend to stall if i keep her in heavy traffic for anything over 40 minutes). </p><p>These are the only issues i have faced with my blue beast. But if anyone asks whether you would recommend dominar to other, my answer is ""hell yeah"".</p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Dominar 400,"<p>Compare to other bike. Its  cost  low . It smooth to ride.Good pick up . Appearance is impressive .It  having good ground clearance, comparing too other bikes its better in cost,speed,& maintenance . 34.5 bhp in this bike, special is abs brake system. It gives smooth & comfortable riding experience to rider . So decision is dominar 400</p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Very good quality,p>Domier is stylish and long ride bike.The style of this bike is very comfortable and cooling system is liquid it help to cool our bike very fast.One another feature is dominar takes instant pickup like ktm. The meter of this bike is good and also give a separate meter for fuel.The headlight style is good which shows dominar is a good quality bike.</p>,5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Speedy,<p>I just only have a riding experience which was awesome. It is perfect for long journey state to state tour. It's 6  gear is wow gives highest pickups and high speed. It's look is ok. Best for long tour. Provide high standard .</p><p>It's better than pulsar from every angle though both are from bajaj.</p><p>It's service center is established in jaigaon yet.</p>,5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
An all round beast for the new youth ,"<p>We bought the bike from sai service bajaj in pune. The buying experience was nothing special even though we were buying the bajaj's flagship model. The showroom and the staff were barely doing adequate, let alone making the experience memorable since it was my first bike from my own money.</p><p>The riding experience has been excellent. Though it takes some getting used to as on the day of delivery, we were finding it difficult to control the acceleration and clutch in the traffic. The clutch was too sensitive. And i felt this when i have been riding for last 11 years and last 5 years on a 200 cc bike.</p><p>But after a couple days, i was able to handle it well. Still, riding in bumper to bumper traffic takes a toll on your body and the bike starts heating very much which can be felt on the legs.</p><p>The acceleration, handling, and agility were too good. No complaints there. Though before 1st service, if we took the bike above 50 even for a few seconds and then when the bike stopped, a burning smell and smoke can be seen coming from somewhere the engines as soon i brought the bike to halt.</p><p>Post 1st servicing and about 1200 km on odo, we took it on a short trip to lonavala and during the ride, the rpm limit light would start glowing as soon as i touched 6000 rpm and around 100 on speedometer and the bike was not crossing 7000 rpm in any case. I was not sure if this was an ecu issue or bajaj has deliberately limited the rpm for till certain km on the odometer.</p><p>The bike looks massive and dominating when standing or passing by any other bike with a good howl from the exhaust, enough to suddenly scare someone in the traffic. Though when we thought of refining the looks even further we found bajaj, unlike ktm, does not provide any customization parts or stickers or decals and because of the paint finish, we were unable to apply any type of vinyl on any parts so as to make it even sharp looking.</p><p>Performance wise we clocked a 0-100 in 6.6 seconds </p><p>Top speed: 144 (possible because of rpm limiter in play )(or else could go very high approx 155)</p><p>Fuel economy: city -- 22 kmpl</p><p>                     highway-- 28 kmpl</p><p>Canyon carving is a bliss on this ....You will just love it</p><p>Pros: </p><p>1.Awesome looks</p><p>2. High powered and high torque engine</p><p>3. Most power available as low as 3500 rpm</p><p>4. Incredibly fast and agile for indian traffic     </p><p>5. Stunning, distinctive and incredibly powerful lights</p><p>6. Nimble handling</p><p>7. Decent fuel economy for a 373 cc beast</p><p>8. Engine heat does not come much to your legs while riding at a decent speed, unlike ktm duke.</p><p>9. Does not put a big dent in your pocket</p><p>10. Excellent general purpose tyres with a rear 150 section</p><p>Cons:</p><p>1. Rpm limiting.</p><p>2. Heavy heating in traffic.</p><p>3. Very heavy and a big turn radius. </p><p>4. Difficult to ride in bumper to bumper traffic for prolonged time.</p><p>5. Uncomfortable and small pillion seat.</p><p>6. No metallic outer tank cover so stick magnetic bags to the tank for long rides</p><p>7. The angle of pillion seat causes the pillion to exert significant weight on rider in a heavy braking situation which pushes the rider on the fuel tank causing significant pain in the groin area. In emergency braking this can cause significant damage</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Beast on the road,"<p>The bike is very good using it for post 3 months and don't have any problem. Was using pulsar 200rs before but this one is great at the price .</p><p>The speed, acceleration , comfort is all the catchy price it is flawless even in traffic and the most beautiful part is its mileage the best at this engine 400cc</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018

A great bike for daily users,"<p>It's a good bike for daily use. It's too comfortable to ride the look of this bike is awesome and the colour concept of this bike is also great.It is a smooth rider and a good cruiser.But i confused at its cc , its a 400 cc bike but the speed this bike is less than any other bikes of that cc. But except this the bike is great thank you bajaj for giving us this type of bike.</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Perfectionist,<p>I was going to buy duke 390 but after buying dominar i don't really regret not buying 390..Superb performance highway ride are delightful.. But as nothing is perfect..So similarly you have to get extra cushioning for pillion some vibes are there...Which will not really bother after 3rd service..In all its a great value for money...Abs works perfectly..Only problem is the people at service center..They always keep the work pending</p>,5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
My experience about bajaj dominar 400,"<p>Bajaj dominar is the best sport bike under 2 lakhs.......It has air cooling engine, 375 cc a great power bike.....But it has some vibration issues but after 2nd servicing the problem gets over. Bike design is good but the brake wire of front tyre creates some problems. Over all it is the great bike......Everyone can try this</p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Review,"<p>I've heard that the bike is awesome and it really is.Its the best bike to go for now under 2 lakhs because if it's power, abilities like abs,best brakes ,best head lights, etc.The only cons in the bike is the little vibrations,and a gear position indicator,and mainly a engine temperature gauge as it is a cruising bike.But anyways we shouldn't expect that much for 1.7 lakhs thought.</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Dominar 400,"<p> bajaj dominar 400 attempts to wear a lot of hats and fulfill many roles. Described as a power cruiser, the dominar 400 could be the one-in-all motorcycle every rider seeks - the daily commuter, performance cruiser and most of all, the long distance tourer promising easy ride ability and comfort. The engine is borrowed from the ktm 390 duke's 373cc engine but has some changes.</p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
After 1 year of dominar use,"<p>Dominar is the best and the powerful bike at a very low price. It is worth of money. </p><p>Riding experience of dominar is premium. It has a powerful 400cc engine which will never let you down in any situation.</p><p>In terms of looks it is a naked version so it may not attract  you much but performance is very good. The best bike under 2 lakhs is obviously dominar .</p><p>Even after having 400cc engine its maintenance is very less compared to the bikes with similar features like rc 390, duke 390, benelli t25.</p><p>But when compared to rc 390 and duke 390 dominars pick up is bit low. But it has a great top speed. It is having a very good breaking system(speaking about abs version). I recommend to buy abs version. Over all rating of bike is top. I recommend people to buy dominar blindly.</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Awesome experience ,<p>Amazing design ever... Super performance     </p><p>Comfort handling........Best controlling capacity.......The price of bike is cheaper compare to other company. ............ Because for 400 cc it was cheaper one...The most important  about this bike was design its melts just to buy for its design and colour .</p>,5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Dominar a winner... Read to find out. ,"<p>1. Buying experience : bajaj is offering the abs version at 1.83 lacs on road with zero depth insurance. Which is good. The waiting is not there and you can get the bike at a required date. Please do pay extra for saari guard or leg guard as bajaj gives this as standard.</p><p> 2. The bike has a road presence and gives you a big bike feel. The bike is stable on highway given its kerb weight of 182 kgs and does not move if a truck passes by. It has enough power to overtake on highway. Rider comfort is very good. For pillion one can put a soft seat. No heating. Vibration is not there if you keep it in its rev range. It generate power in linear manner so city commute is also fine.</p><p> 3. Bike has good power, it's not like the dukes but a linear power in its rev range. It's good to cruise at 100-120 kmph for touring. The looks are good. Overall comfort is good, for pillion, put a soft seat. For wind blast put bajaj as 200 wind shield.</p><p>4. Bajaj service is not too expensive, parts are not so expensive and availability is good. Won't make a hole in your pocket. Overall build of the bike is good. Engine is tried and tested.</p><p>5. Pros, all the bells and whistles of a powerful performance bike like slipper clutch, dual channel abs, 6 speed gearbox, triple digit speed stability, best in class led headlight(no need of projectors) at an affordable price. Cons, no metal tank for tank bag for touring, no gear indicator, 13 liter fuel tank, no center stand(is required if you have to oil the chain), exposed wiring for abs, no windshield to sport the naked bike look.</p><p>Overall a value for money purchase in current times. </p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Crazy rider,"<p>Buying experience means the cost is good price 400cc bike, riding experience is awesome, looks super and performance also good, service and maintenance also very nice. I suggest this bike to buy those who are going to prefer less than 2 lakhs. Compare to ktm and honda cbr 250 bajaj dominar is too good.</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Don't buy elephant buy dominar faster and non stop and great and amazing experience,"<p>The bajaj dominar 400 is the next step for the company: the dominar series of motorcycles will sit above the pulsar range, and not just in displacement. The starting point is this, the dominar 400. It sports a host of features – a 373cc fuel injected engine with three spark plugs, liquid cooling, a twin spar frame, a rear disc brake and abs. Its standout feature is the led headlamp, which offers possibly the best illumination among indian motorcycles at the time of its launch. The all-digital instrument cluster is a ‘reverse lcd’ type, and offers a lot of information including twin trip meters, a clock and a shift light. The fact that it shares components with other models in its lineup as well its sister company ktm’s models has helped bajaj achieve the pricing it has. Fit and finish, however, are a cut above the price bracket, and the royal enfield classic 350, while catering to a slightly different target audience, should be just a bit worried about the impact the dominar can have on the price bracket. Prices for the dominar start at rs 1.41 lakhs (ex-showroom).</p><p>Collapse</p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018

Good one except service centers,"<p>Booking and delivery of the bike was a bit bad i booked the bike and once they brought it from the yard it's clutch liver was bent.

The hearing trouble is not much noticeable. It's fun to ride.</p><p>Service i should say bajaj should take care of their staff with proper training.

Tremendous,<p>The technology is excellent. Riding experience is very tremendous (on highway). Look is also very nice. But it has some drawbacks. It has no central stand which is very essential for various purposes. The idle rpm remains high as a result it creates noise and also makes unnecessary pressure on gearbox. It is not recommended for city ride.</p>,4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
The big bike for big boys really lives up to its hype,"<p>I got my bike on the 14th of july, the day i said goodbye to my 200ns. I did a test ride beforehand and it felt so amazing i was readily convinced to own one for myself. The design is more attractive in real life, maybe because of the dark colors as the design becomes subtle. The acceleration is what i love so much. For a bike of this weight, speeding isn't a problem..Especially after 3500rpm, the bike felt like it glides, which i enjoy so much. Initially, i had pain in my arm joints as i had to adjust my seating position. Once i got it right, it was very comfi. </p><p>One possible con is that the bike is a heavy bike with high seat level, so those below 5'7"" might need to be more careful while handling it in idle mode or between traffic jams. And petrol consumption is quite high if your daily commute involves traffic jams, no wonder from a 400cc mycl. Overall, i am proud to be among the owners of such an amazing bike. Did 1600kms so far, and more to come during the dry season holidays. Thank you, bajaj for 'just the right' kind of bike. </p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Fantastic,<p>Bike is so good and the average is very good. When you ride the bike you feel the power of 400cc it is great man love it.I ride it to manali and it is very powerful to speed i reach 140kmp and it's fuel tank cover is making nose and it is his bad for me but over all the bike is very good and it's exhaust is very classy </p>,5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Champ,"<p>I  just couldn't wait for driving with its sound ,looks and the way speed took me and it's time for my champ after a month for a day break at service station and  no negative marks for my bike. The front side looks gorgeous and of cause its the mans bike i think tail portion should be little bit down and the back tyre one point bigger one</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Sporty cruiser ,"<p>Buying experience from pioneer bajaj (trivandrum, enchakkal) is satisfying. The seating is really great. Comfortable to go for long ride. Looks really really awesome. Performance is super. I have done about 3400 km and done the first service. I enjoy riding the dominar 400. Pros: looks, value for money, headlight. Cons: the cap that covers the nut in the crash guard fall off while riding. I lost 2 caps (this is not a huge issue but still for a new bike this should not happen).</p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Its not a title its my experience,"<p>The bajaj dominar 400 was instant love for me. Being a bajaj pulsar 200ns rider for many years, the bajaj dominar 400 isan upgrade which i had been waiting for a long time. Right from price to features list and build quality, the bike has all that an average Indian biker desires from his motorcycle.In these 5 odd months with the bajaj dominar 400, i have ridden the bike extensively in city traffic as well on several highway rides. The bike gave me the best efficiency of 29 km/l in cities and 28 km/l in highways. I use only 93 octane petrol in the motorcycle and have been able to achieve a top speed of 156 km/h (speedo indicated)found the bajaj dominar 400 to be a more powerful bajaj pulsar 200ns. The handling is confidence inspiring but on muck and mud one has to be particularly careful as the mrf tyres have strict limitations. The headlamp is very effective during night rides but is rendered completely useless during rain.The bike feels stable at 90 km/h even over bumps, but i would advise fellow riders not to venture out and test the durability of the alloys by continuously riding fast over bad roads.The power delivery is smooth between 4,000 to 5,500 rpm, but it is effortless to stall the bike below 3,500 rpm. The best mileage can be achieved by keeping the engine speed around 4,000 rpm. Each fuel bar in the instrumentation represents roughly 25 km of distance covered, and the bike has around 3.5 litres of reserve.I did the first service of my new bajaj dominar 400 at the 750 km mark, and the oil and filter change cost me inr 1,200. The oil used was the genuine 10w50 grade which is a fully synthetic oil sourced from total. The second service was at 5,000 km and my service engineer did not change the oil. The third (which is the last free service) will be done soon being an off-road enthusiast, i have also taken the bike over surfaces which average users won’t, and the bajaj dominar 400 found no problems.Braking response is very good, and the abs has been a life saver. Even after constant usage, the bite from the discs did not show any noticeable signs of fading. The engine too does not heat up even at traffic jams or non-stop mumbai to pune rides.Pillion comfort has been great and a lot of my female friends not only complimented on the styling of the bike but also on the comfort i am really happy with the bajaj dominar 400 and thankful to bajaj auto for giving making such a fantastic motorcycle at an affordable price.</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018

Be a dominated in the road,"<p>Before all that, am big fan of bajaj since when i started riding pulsar 150cc, now its time to tell about my dominar experience, amazing riding experience, worth buying for that price, omg performance of dominar for that segment is more satisfied & very comfort ride to go touring, servicing and maintenance is very good, because being an old customers for bajaj company & popular bajaj show room mysore, overall its amazing tour bike & i'll be waiting for more & more best in tour or sport bikes, best of luck bajaj for future bikes...</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Incredibly stable,"<p>One thing that you will feel when you ride this bike is that, it is an incredibly stable and planted motorcycle. The level of confidence the bike gives you even at triple digit speeds is simply awesome.</p><p>Another thing i like about this bike is that there is plenty of torque at any speed.</p><p>You feel like you have complete command over it at any speed.</p><p>Its weight is a boon in high-speeds and during crosswinds, and a curse in low speeds and at parking lots.</p><p>Braking department, might not give you the best stopping distance, but definitely does the job responsibly. And abs is a lifesaver. </p><p>Slipper clutch is very handy, hassle free down shifts.</p><p>People talk about vibration, but never bothered me,even during long rides</p><p>If you know what kind of bike you want, if dominar fits the bill, then just go for it, it won't fail you. In fact it might surprise you.</p><p>All the best,ride with all safety gears.Cheers.</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
The bike which is meant for all purpose!!,"<p>1.

dominar  difference,<p>The bike is awesome but i think bajaj have to increased the rpm of the dominar 400  because sometimes i try to speedup the bike the felling is great in pickup. Bike feels premium quality. The tank is awesome seat quality is best  tyres n front big disc is also awesome.  But one think is not good    the headlight width  the model of cs400 in auto expo is superb but in dominar the headlight width n look is different not good  light quality is best but look is  just  ok  and the bike have not enough space to install other horns           the handle looks very bad  </p>,5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Great value for money,<p>Enough freedom was given during test driving.</p><p>Also the demo of vehicle was given to a great in-depth level.</p><p>Only minor issue is petrol tank vibration at certain rpm level.</p><p>Led headlamp is awesome and path breaking</p><p>Shown room do arrange touring session.</p><p>Driving is pleasure in city and highway</p><p>Road grip is better</p><p>Pickup is awesome.

Honest review of bajaj dominar,"<p>Buying experience is good .</p><p>Riding of this bike is awesome even though it is 182kg while riding u don't feel that weight. It is easy to handle in city ,on the highway it's very stable at triple speed i ride this awesome machine lot in the city no heat issue like ktm .</p><p>Total its looks and performance is great </p><p>Bajaj is providing good servicing especially for this bike well trained mechanics.</p><p>Pros: looks, easy handling,good torque, stable at high speed ,low maintenance</p><p>Cons: it's better if it has 15-17lts tank</p><p>Little bit vib in 4.5k rpm which is negligible </p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Power and reliability,<p>I Was not aware of the brilliant performance of this bike either on highways or in city. Before buying i was only focused on touring on this bike. But now i have done more city kms than on highways and it never disappointed me. Excellent performance and smoothness of the engine took my heart. No second thought should come into your mind when you are looking for powerful motorcycle for highways or occasional rides and city rides under this budget. You can buy some accessories to make your ride more comfortable. I have done leh - ladakh trip on this bike this year. And seriously i have seen people struggling with their bike problems but touch-wood i have completed my trip with minor difficulties. All thanks to my lovely white horse. </p>,5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
The elephant in the room,<p>The buying experience was very beautiful event though there was a large group waiting for the same bike.</p><p>The riding experience was very good but the seats could be more nicely made</p><p>The mileage is enough for the bike with this much capacity and power under its slaves</p><p>The service cost is very less and good</p>,5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Dominar : its just awesome,"<p>Dominar is very wonderful machine. </p><p>I had travelled 950kms with out switching off the bike continuously. Its just amazing machine. Its a very good cruiser & sports bike. And i am using the same for daily commute. </p><p>Specially i wanted to tell you all about its maintenance cost. Its too cheap while compared to other bikes in the market like duke, royal enfield etc.</p><p>The main thing which attracted before buying the bike is its power & pricing. </p><p>I can say you that its a very good motorcycle as far as my experience. Am a rider & i do long drives.</p><p>Thank you guys</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Black lion,"<p>Its excellent bike,its get pickup in seconds ,good abs brake its stop in few metres, eye catching colour but in off  road ride its shocker not good it give lot of jerks this is only minus point in this point overall excellent bike.If you park this bike all persons come near and watch and ask about its price, pickup, top speed , which company , fuel , etc .</p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Good daily commute machine and also cruiser.,<p>Good bike for daily commute and touring. I have the bike from 2 months and i have ridden the bike for 7500 km. It gives you a big bike feel the aggressive look draws attention in public. It is a good touring machine i have done a 1300 km tour the riding position is very comfortable also at 100-120 kmph. Overall it worth what it cost. Good work bajaj.</p>,5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Review,<p>A good and powerful bike. Fond of its looks and performance. The service of bajaj auto is par excellence. Provides service in majority of cities. Genuine parts easily available. But mileage is one of the cons of dominar 400. Only 10-15 km/l initially then latest is 20-25 km/l. Overall an excellent 400cc bike..</p>,5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Bajaj dominar will blow your racing mind..,"<p>I bought this beast in khammam,riding this bike will feel like you are riding an f1 race bike pick up speed is much more better than royal enfield. Looks little small compare to bullet.Servicing needs to be done every 2 months as i rode this bike in rural areas and for long tour rides.The major problem in this dominar is its height as i am 6 foot tall it looks little awkward to ride on this.Major pros is the pickup speed and flexibility.</p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Mystic ride in a magical bike,"<p>1. Never owned but my close friend owned a month ago.</p><p>2.

Look wise:- beauteous feels good to eyes, performance is very good.</p><p>4.Can't say about 4th point since didn't experienced yet.</p><p>5.But excellent since took some interval of time to pickup, vibration of some parts like tail number plate, gear pad, rear brake pad, rear brake should be update have some problems these are some cons which should not have in a bike like 400cc, and all the other things comes in pros....</p><p>*if an individual feels to ride then i must say gear up and load onto the dominar</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
If you are 35 you can consider re. Otherwise get d400!! ,"<p>Brought this bike on jan 25 2017! my bike is from first batch for sure! </p><p>Buying experience was not that bad. Showroom guys are also excited  like me.</p><p>I own royal enfield Thunderbird 2010 used it for 6+ years! so i know how re service, bike problems, etc. </p><p>Now i am using dominar for 6+ months and drive over 6000+km & done second service last month. Overall maintenance cost, ride quality, power (over re 350) is impressive! and the price is just 1.74l on road which is awesome! d400 is my second bike and i love the decision i made! </p><p>My tbts gives me 35+ avg mileage and the best is 49kmpl for me (some people claimed 55kmpl!. I don't know how they drive)  35 is my avg because i don't care about mileage! i like to use my bike according to my mood! no matter what is the rpm or speed! mostly 60 to 80kmph and max speed was 110! </p><p>Come to d400! avg is 24 to 26 , best is 29, worst is 19.8! i drove like the way i said above! but my riding style is changed a lot! now i feel like i need more power! yes d400 will makes you happy! it makes you drive more! even when i went to city for a short ride i hate to come back home! i take my d400 for another 10km for no reason! and come back home! :) you never hate or feel bored! on d400.

Dominar 400 the mind-blowing bike,"<p>I am very satisfied after buying this bike. This is a very cool looking bike and awesome pickup. I've enjoyed the speed while riding on the highway at 120kmph but this bike can get more speed. Very sounding engine, smooth on high speed, balance and grip over the track is very good. You can ride for long time without being tired. Bajaj service is satisfying. I recommend this bike for those riders who loves to ride on the highways with high speed.</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Dominar - dominating the devil ,"<p>Hello everyone i am glad that i got opportunity to tell about my beast. I bought this bike because for that price ( below 2 l ) we are getting dual channel abs  ( rider safety) , slipper clutch ( rider comfort for gear changing ), full led ( amazing ), best power and torque with good 400 cc. As bajaj is an Indian company i am proud that it is offering abs, non of other companies like ( yamaha, honda, suzuki ) not offering abs with that price range. I think as everyone know the pros by looking into specifications. But only a true rider will know the performance and cons. Lets discuss about those. The performance is  excellent. There is  no single low to tell regarding performance. </p><p>Cons:- low fuel tank capacity, vibrations after reaching 120kmph ( for every bike the vibrations are common at specific rpm ) </p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
I love this bike because it is a powerful machine,"<p>This bikes performance is good.</p><p>I didn't owned this bike but I rode this bike.</p><p>373cc engine, abs, led head & tail lights and many of hidden features are also available in this bike.</p><p>This bajaj bikes is very very good bike for bike lovers.

Best bike with a cheap price,"<p>First of all its makes a very proud feeling while buying it because it is a 400 cc category bike.

Costs nearly 2000 its very cheap compared to the category and cc of the bike.</p><p>Till now i have not found any cons,</p><p>Finally i would say again that it is the best bike you can get in that price.</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018

Value for money bike ,"<p>The buying process of dominar 400 is excellent . You just have to book it and have to wait at least 15 days and that will create more eagerness in you and then your bike came and you can go to your near buy dealer and buy it </p><p>i love riding it . When you ride this bike you feel like yes a heavy bike is riding . People notice it like it is imported bike as people are not much aware about it and bajaj also not interested in advertising it .</p><p>Talking about looks performance and other factors then the best compliment i got once is when one unknown person asked me "" sir is it of 1400 cc bike "" as at the back logo it is written like d400 so he thought it is of 1400 cc . So you can imagine how it look like </p><p>i am not much aware and experienced it because mine is new bike and serviced it once that cost me 1150 rupees which i guess is ok types and can afford it in 3 to 4 months </p><p>the best part of this bike is i already mentioned "" heavy bike ... Engine is good .. Pick up excellent ...Looks awesome ..."" </p><p>The cons are lack behind in 2 or 3 things 1. No gear indicator so if you are riding at 90 to 100 speed you never come to know whether it is in 5 or 6th gear and have to check yourself so might confusing some time . Fuel tank is just 13 liter so every 3rd day you have to go to fuel pump, at-least i do the same </p><p>other then this yes it is indian made bike so very rough and tough and love to ride it so go and buy it as it is value for money </p><p>opes its 6:30 time to go home ...Excited have to ride dominar 400 :)</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018

Great deal,"<p>Good experience</p><p>price at which it is available can destruct the bike market. A sport cruiser being available at 136k inr and 150k inr for abs (ex-showroom), churning out 35ps of power and 35nm of torque is pretty awesome.Plus point is the way in which they have done the advertising, they have catched a lot of eyes. Already it is trending on you tube.</p><p>Moreover, with its launch they have killed their own product, rs200. So probably before taking such an extreme step, they must have been planned well.( Though one is naked and other isn't, but that may matter only for fewer audiences , considering they have to leave 10ps of power behind)</p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Dominator for every thing,<p>It is very amazing bike that i ever had.It feels more sporty and more fuel efficient and its performance is speech less there are nice color combinations hyper mobility nice head lamps which can focus a long distance and appropriate for highways and night riders have more fuel capacity due to which it can cover long distance</p>,4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Wandering review of dominar,"<p>In some of the bajaj showroom.,Service is very bad.Bike is very light easy to handle in corners .Ecu update is the best thing yet. According to me bajaj can make their service good like how ktm does.Pros i can say best bike in this price segment.Cons it vibrates & its fuel tank has less capacity its only 13 litre .It would have at-least given 16 litre</p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Predator on road,<p>I am in love with this bike it looks like predator on road with claws and jaws led headlamp is eye catching looks superb in night body is proportionate seat is very comfortable i own midnight blue colour .</p><p>Seat is very comfortable and relaxed riding position is upright which is good for long rides and tours yes in traffic i feel like i m riding only in first gear which heats engine and cause damage to the engine because minimum speed you need to shift to 2nd gear is 20 km/h yes it is because dominar is not meant for the traffic it is a power cruiser. Power to gear ratio is excellent yes fuel economy is between 25 to 30 km/l and last but not the least dominar 400 is value for money no doubt. Thanks</p>,4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
More than two month's experience,<p>I'm not talking about the good things because you can better read on other websites i will be talking about bad things there are few problems which i faced while purchase new d400 first is vibration issue near by tank after crossing 100 it's stat vibrating and other one display problem which is automatically blinking sometimes.... All is problem is solved now .... But they took too much time to rectify the vibration problem.....If you have more budget go for 390 ktm...But at this price range i don't think so that some other companies can provide you this power pack machine..... Overall 8 out off 10 including 1 riding style 2 price range 3 customer service 4 machine durability... #Ridesafegofar</p>,5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
One of the best bike by bajaj till date,"<p>The company is offering a 400cc bike at a very aggressive price. So whats the delay?</p><p>the riding experience is on point for daily commuter or tourers this bike is meant for you. Take the bike out there won't be a single person who's not staring at the bike. If you're into drag races then this bike is not meant for you, though it's a 400  cc bike the power it delivers is not up to the point. Don't get me wrong the bike is superb but the company has done some cost cutting.</p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Value for money & beast,"<p>I was planning to buy a bike for my daily commute,some weekend long rides and should look pretty in streets.Frankly,i was never planning to buy bajaj dominar400??,i was actually planning to buy ktm duke390 or the rc390 but my parents we're against those and then i showed them the pictures of the dominar400 and they approved to buy it because of the low price & lower back seat height than the ktms. But after i bought this bike now i feel like it was a good decision than the ktm cause you can ride this in very long distance without having any back pains also the abs works really well too. The looks are very cool and the bike looks a little fat than its competitors and its very appealing,and the pillion seat is way more comfortable than other bikes??.The cooling of the bike is also better than other bikes in this category.The only con for this  bike can be the gear indicator i think it should been there for the beginners but if you are a pro in riding bikes it won't be a problem at all.Then also if you are a skinny guy the bike is little heavy if it falls side ways ??.</p><p>My only advise for those who are planning to buy the royal enfield (especially) or the ktms you guys should really test ride this bike??</p><p>cause its really gives you the value for money</p><p>and if you are planning to buy one try to get the abs version even that is little more to pay for the normal cause it is worth it.</p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018

Dominate the night...,"<p>Good performance & mileage, all-led headlight, 2-channel abs & slipper clutch, high paint quality, informative instrument console,43 mm front forks,affordable to own, high speed stability...</p><p>The best part of buying the dominar 400 is its powerful engine and eye popping.</p><p>The motorcycle is equipped with dual channel abs for enhanced protection on any kind of surface while slipper clutch helps in avoiding the torque loss during the gearshifts.</p><p>Dominar 400 comes with three layer paint coating, providing a rich and exclusive finish to the bike. Not just that, it even comes with 3 totally different paint schemes from other bajaj motorcycles.</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Dominar 400: best sacrifice for a tourer,"<p>I always had a feeling that indian manufacturers never understood customers when it comes to tourer bikes. Almost all bikes available here in budget(read less than 2 lacs) are good examples of this. </p><p>For a tourer you dont need outright power, but an engine capable of delivering a smooth rangebound 80-100 kmph ride without straining rider or bike. Now there is posture. We are talking about 8-12 hours on saddle. For that an upright position with minimal widblast would do a world of good. Finally the most important thing which almost every manufacturer take it for granted. Even though there are several other small yet significant things like tank capacity, seat cushioning, ease of installing saddle bags are there, but nothing comes remotely as important as this. Safety!</p><p>this is where i think bajaj has outplayed its competition by miles. Dominar 400 doesn't have a big tank (eg. Mojo) nor it is the most suitable bike for keeping a saddle(eg. Res). But the combination of dual channel abs and slipper clutch will ensure that you journey will be safe even though its sporty riding stance and wind buffeting will leave you a little tired. It's engine which is a rebored version of duke 390 heart will surprise you pleasently most of times. I still wonder how bajaj almost killed off its infamous heating and other traffic woes. Honestly, i could not ask for anything more for the price at which bajaj is offering this. </p><p>But deep inside, i wish bajaj planked this engine and all the features in the form of a more powerful avenger. That will answer all issues of aspirant tourers who are planning get a new bike below 2 lacs. And yes, i would be the first one to get my cheque ready when it happens anytime in future. </p><p>To summarise i would like to list out following good and not so good things about dominar 400</p><p>good:</p><p>*  dual channel abs, slipper clutch.</p><p>*  Good power with fantastic midrange.</p><p>*  Big bike feel.</p><p>*  Comfortable seats</p><p>*  less heat dissipation</p><p>*  more than value for money for what it provide.</p><p>Not so good:</p><p>*  not a proper cruiser (more inclined to sporty riding). Bajaj likes to call it as sport cruiser which makes sense.</p><p>*  Small fuel tank</p><p>*  minimum wind protection.</p><p>*  Not ideal for saddle bags.</p><p>*  Less refined compared to mojo.</p><p>*  Pillions do not have much to cheer except for safety</p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
My experience with the dominar400.,<p>Because of its cheaper rate in 400cc segment its a great value for money.</p><p>The riding experience is good the sitting posture of the bike is much comfortable so but some vibration occurs when we apply 1st gear and full throttle.</p><p>Looks wise its cool performance is so...Cool just drop your gear and disappear.</p><p> Service provided by the bajaj is good and cheaper then other companies its a low maintenance bike..So..I was just tension free because 1st service is of 750km and 2nd is of 4500 to 5000km </p><p>the good thing of bike is led headlamp the power the cool looks..The engine and exhaust sound.. Like a turbocharger.</p><p>The bad thing is cheap paintwork on tank. I feel it becomes fade by time but not so much another thing is fuel consumption. The next is there is no gear indicator. Overall the bike is good and awesome in comparison to other 400cc segment bikes.</p>,4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Beast is here,"<p>Since it is my 3rd bike after yamaha r15 and i feel amazing while riding the dominar 400. I am using this bike for the daily commute and believe me after driving the r15, you will feel the power while riding this beast dominar 400.</p><p>As i was concerned about the looks, but this bike nailed it in looks and performance. Performance of dominar is superb in this price category and looks is superb. As i have rideen 600 kms recently so i will  service this bike on 750 kms. It's giving me an average about 33-36 kms in city. Since there is no cons for this bike as i have ride less kms and i don't find any negative thing till today. So finally bajaj has done a great job again. Proud to the owner of this beast dominar 400.</p><p>A big thumbs up for bajaj </p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
The dominating story,"<p>Hi everybody,firstly i want to tell that the bike produces 35 of torque and horsepower and it weighs roughly 180 to 190 kg depending on fuel in the tank. The bike is said to be a power cruiser  so it is of its own league as the other bikes in the segment are duke 390 race oriented and the mojo and himalyan which are just made for cruising purpose so it is a best all rounder. It does not heat up like ktm in city nor in highway rides it also has the best fuel efficiency of 25 in city and 35 on highway respectively. So the 13 litres tank is more than adequate and the main part of the light which is superb on night rides and this light is best in class or higher even the seats are comfortable so the highway journeys are not an issue even the pair of tires are affordable if you want to replace and the bajaj parts are the most cheapest in the market so it is reliable but the thought in people is, it is bajaj so the fit and finish won't be good but it is not the case in this bike it has soft touch elements and nicely finished switches and everything on the bike is in place and dose not annoy the owner.Coming to the negative side of the bike i would have wished a better side guard as i felt it was a bit on a cheaper quality and the missing of a gear position indicator which would help for new riders and the features like distance to empty and the other things which were present in the ktm but finally this is too much of expectation as it is priced at just 1.92Lakh on road bangalore for abs version which is mind blowing so in my view i think i have covered all the points which will explain this beast bike. </p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Awesome bike in india ,"<p>This is the best bike i ever seen. This bike give you a best riding quality and the best performance styling bike and its comes with abs version abs will save your life in most unexpected situation. This was designed to rule the highways. India's best touring bike for the price range of 1.5Lakh and the led head lamps looks pretty good, seat is very soft. This is the best value for money bike in india right now</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
The beast...Dominor 400,<p>It is one best bike in this segment.After buying this bike i just fall in love with the bike.It is comfortable for small as well as long rides.Dominor got looks...It looks very nice from front.The performance is also very good..It has got torque...And it reaches 0-100 km/h in just 6.8 To 7seconds.Bajaj gives a good services and maintenance is also moderate..</p>,5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018

The body of dominar  is the eye catchy ,"Well first my friends  told me about  this bike dominar i was like yep again a indian bike of bajaj,But after seeing  the bike i feel like let me ride it, and my uncle brought the bike.That first  look of the bike i said it's my bike uncle and he said no i was sad but when i ask for the keys he gave me first time and when i start the bike i really love the sound and after ridding its i said give me but it's on hold...Let see i would get the bike or not.",4,pos,bikewale,25-03-2019
Long trip travelling ,"Properly change oil check coolant. It's more than enough as usual, tyres pressure such things. Rider height is important  minimum 5.9  because during the travel at of roads riders height is big dealers point, nobody can explain about the motorcycle ((dominar))  just in my case giving me  the bike for a test drive within a 1 or 2-furlongs may be,  and somebody sit with me a pillion (as a dealer person.)The worst thing is the company representative pillion rider ride and shows me the skill of the person, not a motorcycle. (when i  finishing 2 furlongs after ) they try to teach me  what is bike and how to ride horribly .So bajai improves more at least what purpose of the bike .Customers what they want to know about dominar d400 .",4,pos,bikewale,25-06-2018

Read it carefully,"Read it carefully before buying this bike this is my very very honest review my brothers. Buying experience: about this bike is that the managers and the staffs in the showroom are not satisfied for me while buying Riding experience: the riding experience in this bike is the performance is great.I not satisfied with the suspension the bike is only comfortable for good roads and worst for bumpy roads.I feel very tired in the bumpy roads.I hate the suspension.I has a power lag issue in the bike.I went to the service centre for solving the problem but the problem has not solved ate i very disappointed about this problem. Bajaj has the worst service centre.I has changed more than 3 service centre because of worst service centre provided by bajaj. I complaint to bajaj but no response. When this is launched by other company this bike is the best bike i would say I has faced a vibration in petrol tank portion it is feeling irritated to ride the bike.This problem was also not resolved by the service centre.The breaking is first in this class it has saved me many times in many situation thanks for the wonderful breaking The headlights are the best i ever seen.When the bike is in high beam every one will definitely dye because of the bright led lights The tyres are wonderful .It's really awesome. The looks is excellent i has brought the bike while launching when i took the bike to the road every one follows me to see the bike The bike is very stable and i not even loss the control even in 160kmph it's really awesome thanks for the weight of 182kg I has faced a gear issue that when we put a first gear there, the big thug thug sound i really do sad about this problem .This problem has faced by most of my dominar owner club (doc) brothers The service cost is reasonable. Even though i gave 5 stars even facing these much issues because this bike is excellent in performance and safety .",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018

I am waiting for this bike  cs400 concept by bajaj in 2014,"<p>Built on the cs400 concept, the bajaj dominar 400 retains most of the styling from the prototype revealed publicly at the 2014 auto expo. Deriving its name from the spanish word ‘dominar’ which means ‘to excel or exceed in power’, bajaj dominar 400 combines adventure of a cruiser and comfort of a tourer. With dominar 400, bajaj has introduced a new moniker in its portfolio which has the potential to carry the tag of the next flag bearer. Coming to the power, it derives mechanical strength from single cylinder petrol engine displacing 373cc paired to the six-speed gearbox. In terms of features, it gets various segment first tech along with a handful of other advanced equipment bajaj has introduced for the first time in a model.</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Cruise the powerful way,"<p>This is best bike according to its price with other competitor like ktm, r15 etc. If you want a purchase a new bike, i thing you should purchase this bike because it have a awesome look. You know that it is made by bajaj. It is very fast bike acording to his cost. Its speed approx 150km/h. Its big wheels give you better grip.

Great machine ,Buying experience was great got the bike delivered on time. Its been like a year and riding experience have been great with this bike as i previously owned a re 350 classic so if i compare it this bike i can take anywhere i want with confidence. Nothing much to say about look and performance as that's evident from the reviews we see and the user experiences that are shared. Maintenance is not much of an issue but the service quality is where i am not much impressed (maybe the service centres in my place trivandrum doesn't have much of a skilled labours to service this machine). The pros i would say everything is a pro. But i would say service and the details on the instrument cluster could have included more information as well as an abs off switch with live by wire function as well suspension is good compared to rest but could have done better. Overall u get a great machine for the money you pay.,5,pos,bikewale,25-03-2019
The bike you deserve,Very settle and reliable bike. Manoeuvre even in city traffic conditions is sleek.New colour combinations available on the bike are really eye catching.There may be a some issues you'll face by the bajaj service centres and policies. Many after market accessories are available for dominar 400 which will make the bike really appealing.,4,pos,bikewale,25-12-2018
Dominar owners should be given some good service.,I bought it from a smaller dealer hence could not receive good facility. I personally love dominar 400 and own it since Aug 2018. Service is nice. Bajaj showroom people have some different attitudes with costumers which we don't like. No premium service for premium costumers. At-least those who want to buy premium bikes should be given extra attention which lacks.,5,pos,bikewale,25-11-2018
In this price thats a perfect bike to buy,"It's nice bike, suspension of this bike so good and speed i think not good but 140 speed is enough for tourist or anything overall very nice bike anyone want to buy a lower price and highly performance bike so choose this bike very nice bike display, suspension, display and many other features are available in this bike.",4,pos,bikewale,25-10-2018
 just go for hyper riding ! ,I am not a owner of this bike. But i ride this bike once. One thing i like the most is the  abs brake. It is very useful for riding in the rainy condition. The full led headlight gives a very clear vision at night.The riding position is good. It never be a reason for back pain. The bajaj dominar 400 is better than royal enfield. All royal enfield owners agree this ! dominar 400 is the value for money bike.,5,pos,bikewale,25-06-2018
The amazing dominar,"First of all i was always  waiting for bajaj to launch a big premium bike and hence it happened ""the bajaj dominar 400 .I pre - booked the bike and got delivered a amazing manner within a week .The first ride awesome as per its name it dominated the road.It had a quick response and lots of power.The instrument cluster was great .The only disadvantage is there is no gear changing indicator .The body is bulk & heavy and looks like a beast .The muscles around the tank and tail make it little tough in looks .The service and maintaining is as per standard no issues in it .After above 15,000 the bike have regular vibrations in tank parts and suspension gets little weak Chain sprocket has to be changed regularly.",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
"for God's sake stop those ""hatti mat palo"" ads ","the buying experience was good quick and easy the guys at the showroom were nice.
The riding experience is just awesome u get a naked with a comfort level of a cruiser
looks are just mind boggling and ya it is a head Turner... 
ps:- the bike looks a lot more bulkier and beefy in person
performance is were the Dominar thrives the low end is linear and smooth but  bit short..
but as the torque kicks in at 6500 rpm the mid range  is just massive.. the top range is where I think the bike is lagging and ya you can use this beast for anything and it will give you the thing you were looking for... A big thumbs up to bajaj..  Although the it shares the same engine with the RC 390 and the Duke 390 the power delivery is very linear and smooth you don't feel the kick in the pants as the KTM's
pro's :- looks, power, comfort, handling.
cons :-
 should have had a gear indicator, the buzz kicks in at 4000 rpm which is too early , and please stop making those ads... we know that the Dominar shares the market with classic 350 but the whole humanity knows no matter what happens people who like RE will buy it no matter what RE offers them and as A practical person I find it a bit offensive so just think how those guys",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Its an experience of dominance.,"The first and foremost thing : if you are going to use it as a daily commute, this is not the bike you are looking for. It's not a city bike. Tours and exploring are the main gig of this super cruiser. Once you hop on the saddle and revv the engine, you will feel invincible.The only thing missing is the gear number indicator.Apart from that, you are signing up yourself for a bike that you are going to get addicted to in no time. Why wouldn't you love a bike which makes you feel strong and of-course dominating!",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Rider,<p>Its outer look is very fantastic.It is very comfortable for riding long distance and short distance also.Its mileage is very good.By which we get more benefit in low investment.Its speed is very nice for racing.Sheet of this bike is very flexible and comfortable by which we cant get pain in our body.Road grip is very nice of this bike.</p>,4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018

Dominar is fabulous bike ,"<p>The new bajaj dominar 400 attempts to wear a lot of hats and fulfill many roles. Described as a power cruiser, the dominar 400 could be the one-in-all motorcycle every rider seeks - the daily commuter, performance cruiser and most of all, the long distance tourer promising easy ride ability and comfort. Bajaj has positioned it slap bang in royal enfield territory. In fact, bajaj wants to wean away a section of royal enfield buyers by offering a performance-oriented motorcycle with modern features at a very attractive price. But does the dominar 400 have what it takes to meet all its expectations?</p><p>Looks-wise, the bajaj dominar 400 strikes a macho pose with its front-biased muscular looks, complemented by a sculpted fuel tank. In fact, you could say the design has traces of faint inspiration from the ducati diavel - generally in the stance and particularly in the instrument cluster design. Like the diavel, the dominar 400 has a split unit with an all-digital main console displaying speed, rev counter and the like, and a small fuel-tank-mounted console for the tell-tale lights displaying side stand, high beam and the like. But that's where the similarities end. The fat 43 mm front fork of the dominar 400 makes the front look beefy while the full-led headlight with the auto-headlight on feature underlines the bike's premium positioning in the entry-level performance bike segment.</p><p>Swing a leg over it, and the first thing you notice is that this is no light bike at 182 kg kerb weight. For comparison, that's nearly as much as a royal enfield classic 350. But the weight seems to magically disappear soon as you're on the move. The friendly ergonomics are welcoming, be it the riding position or the flat wide handlebar and the comfortable split dual seat. And crawling through traffic, the dominar 400 doesn't make itself feel like a bulky motorcycle at all.</p><p>The engine is borrowed from the ktm 390 duke's 373cc engine but has some changes, including triple spark technology and a remap to change the torque curve and power output. So, output is down to 34.5 bhp and 35 nm of torque but that re-tune is more in line with meeting the bike's slated objective of being a relaxed cruiser than outright pocket rocket. The result is an engine which doesn't have overwhelming acceleration, yet enough grunt for effortless cruising - be it on the highway or on uphill sections we encountered on our over 150 km ride.</p><p>The slipper clutch ensures there's no drama, whether you're up shifting or engaging in aggressive downshifts while tackling corners. What also impresses is straight-line stability and excellent ride quality - be it on an open highway or while tackling broken sections and road undulations. The dominar 400 employs a perimeter frame and contoured swingarm. The new chassis, made of precision pressed high strength steel, provides a low center of gravity and torsional rigidity. What all this means is that the bajaj dominar 400 stays planted at all speeds, and in all kinds of circumstances. Taking a corner is without drama, but the extra weight robs the bike of some of the expected agility.</p><p>In a way, the bajaj dominar 400 is a well thought-out package - a sort of stepping stone to a bigger, more powerful motorcycle for the rider who is looking to upgrade without breaking the bank. The engine may not have a hooligan personality, but that's not what's intended for its target customer base anyway. What matters is, at no point does the dominar 400 feel overwhelming and that is its biggest strength. It will be welcomed by both new riders and those seeking to upgrade to a performance bike from 125-150 cc motorcycles. It may not 'wow' the experienced rider with its performance, but it ticks all the right boxes. At rs 1.36 lakh (ex-showroom delhi) for the base disc brake variant and rs 1.5 lakh (ex-showroom delhi) for the top-of-the-line variant with dual channel anti-lock brakes, the bajaj dominar 400 makes a compelling case for itself. Will it attract royal enfield fans it's early days yet, and difficult to predict. But that's another story altogether.</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018

Apart from this bike is too good for daily use with good mileage and feels like premium bike and riding dominar is like too joyful and comfortable for long rides too..</p>,4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
About bike ,"<p>Best bike at this price</p><p>Having super power engine 400cc which best at this price with abs at this price </p><p>Good speed reached upto 160 easily built on the cs400 concept, the bajaj dominar 400 retains most of the styling from the prototype revealed public ally at the 2014 auto expo. Deriving its name from the Spanish word ‘dominar’ which means ‘to excel or exceed in power’, bajaj dominar 400 combines adventure of a cruiser and comfort of a tourer. With dominar 400, bajaj has introduced a new moniker in its portfolio which has the potential to carry the tag of the next flag bearer. Coming to the power, it derives mechanical strength from single cylinder petrol engine displacing 373cc paired to the six-speed gearbox</p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Best product from bajaj,"<p class=""margin-top5""><strong>Style</strong></p>
<p class=""margin-top5"">the bike has a decent style and given that it is newly launced you will experience some heads turning moments. It has a mix of of both the race and naked style. Best part is the drl's and its look while you ride. </p>
<p class=""margin-top5""><strong>Engine performance, fuel economy and gearbox</strong></p>
<p class=""margin-top5"">if this is your first bike above 200 or 250 cc then you are sure to experience the power and acceleration. You can pull through tight distances in traffic given the power. Company claims a decent number for fuel economy but it varies on the age and how the bike has been handled / maintained. Gearbox is good however it make a distinct sound when you change gears, the feature of slipper clutch works just fine. Overall it gives an exciting experience. If you have owned bikes above 250 cc, like ktm, kawasaki and others then you may feel this to be less exciting since those bikes have a higher bhp, torque and less weight.</p>
<p class=""margin-top5""><strong>Ride quality &amp; handling</strong></p>
<p class=""margin-top5"">the abs works well on the bike and slipper clutch makes the bike quite efficient, however because the bike is quite heavy one needs to ajust to the weight. Tight turns at junctions are not comfortable. The bike also has good tires but it does not build confidence at high speed turns. In stand still traffic taking the extreme left narrow passage may not work due to the size and weight of the bike.</p>
<p class=""margin-top5""><strong>Final words</strong></p>
<p class=""margin-top5"">overall the bike is worth its price as no other company provides these feature at this price. Ktm's and kawasaki's are superb bikes but it needs bigger wallets. Unable to comment on service costs. </p>
<p class=""margin-top5""><strong>Areas of improvement</strong>  </p>
<p class=""margin-top5"">the engine needs to be refined a bit to give more bhp's and add more excitment.</p>
<p class=""margin-top5"">Suspension or tires to be a little more better to have the confidence for high speed turns.</p>
<p class=""margin-top5"">Bike's etended exhaust to be refined more to give the sports feel. One could experience this at initial gears but at high gear it sound just like other bikes. If only bajaj has made the exhaust sound a little more like the sports bike then the youth would be more attracted with buy this over others.</p><p class=""margin-top5""><strong>Pros</strong><p >features, price</p></p><p class=""margin-top5""><strong>cons</strong><p >weight, power<p class=""margin-top5""></p>",4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2017

Experience the beauty in a ride ,"<p>An awesome model developed by bajaj giving out a decent mileage and a pleasant experience of ride. It gives a spacious comfort of seat and the engine too does not get heated up so quickly. The acceleration for each gear shift has an exceptionally great performance.

Best bike under 2 lakhs. No competition for dominar ,"<p>Many people asking me in rural side , which company and imported bike or what?... Fabulous feeling. Value for money. But service centre people do over-actions . Worst experience. I used old p150 2004 model. 220f.. 200ns ..  Now using dominar . Sometimes i feel not to buy bajaj because of service and they behave like govt employees , they don;t listen what we say ... Worst service..

The real superhero dominor 400.,"<p>Hello everyone ,</p><p>Its December 15 2016 waiting for the beast to launch . The first sight itself i am impressed and made the advance booking , and i took the delivery on 25 January 2017 this is the first batch of dominar in Chennai.</p><p>That was the happiest day in my life i have ever experienced so far. Yes its beyond the words every bike lover will feel that when the get there loved bike.</p><p>Here comes to the riding experience of the bike the engine refinement is like awesome and the way it deliver is power is fantastic . Seating posture is more comfortable than any other 400 bikes in the market as well it is a handsome hulk.Yes the way it looks is just amazing and it is really a head turner in the roads. So far this is the best bajaj product , i know it is derived from ktm 390 but you wont feel that when you gets your hands in it.</p><p>Then service cost is reasonable compare to the royal enfield bikes . The chain sprocket is the part  which you really need to maintain at a regular interval . I used to clean it for every 500kms . All the performance are depends upon the chain for this higher cc bikes . It is giving the impressive mileage of around 34-36kmpl in city and 36-38 in highway. I used to ride the bike at 40 - 50 kmph in the city and 70 - 80 kmph in the highway i mostly use the engine braking to slow down the speed of the bike.</p><p>I don't have any major problem with my bike so far.

Bajaj dominar 400 abs,"<p class=""margin-top5""><strong></strong> <strong>Bajaj dominar 400 has got a agressive design which is leo inspired and has got a decent ergonomics which is good for a tourer, the bike gives you a premium feel while riding, the rear mudgaurd is a bit mess, as far as i concerned  instead of rear mudguard tyre hugger can give a stunning look, the auto head lamps with led lights adds another extra points to the looks. </strong></p>
<p class=""margin-top5""><strong>When it comes to performance the power delivery is very linear and it will be absolutely fun to ride in highways, it has got 35nm torque and 35bhp power. You dont really need aggressive down shifting for overtaking in highway since it has the ability to produce the torque instantly anywhere between the power band, the only disappointment i felt is it cannot be driven at  low speeds at higher gears you can feel the engine lugs  hence it needs frequent downshifts and upshifts in the city ride comparing to other premium segment bikles  and i have tested the fuel economy accurately, it falls somewhere between 30-35 which saves your purse from slimming, the slipper clutch does its job well. The shifting is pretty smooth and nothing is there to complain on it. </strong></p>
<p class=""margin-top5""> </p>
<p class=""margin-top5""><strong>The bike weighs 182 kgs which make it a midsize tourer, although it weighs more you dont feel that once you get on it, in highways it gives you a stable ride which boosts our confidence level, the biggest bombshell for me is although the bike is big it gives you a good handling in city. The exhaust is bassy gives you vroom vroom sound and i am happy with it because i  am not a big fan of dug dug and turr turr sound form re and ktm bikes.</strong></p>
<p class=""margin-top5""><strong>The bike is worth for every penny and it is one of the best in its segment. I am fully satisfied with the bike, every time i ride i feel like dominating the road, yes!!</strong></p>

Macho looks but not powerful enough feel,<p>Dominar - to the name and macho looks of dominar</p><p>Its really disappointing on the exhaust note</p><p>Bajaj should have used louder exhaust from akrapovic or any other with roaring sound</p><p>That would have become a boasting highlight comparison vs royal enfield</p><p>I own a pulsar 200ns.</p><p>I am really excited to change my bike</p><p>But with all the bad experience had in various service centre for my p200ns</p><p>I have decided not to buy any bajaj bikes anymore</p><p>Its not that i dont like bajaj. Bajaj fails to moderate their service centres</p><p>Bajaj should launch a service app. Only by which the services in authorised centres should be done.

Prefect,"Prefect for long ride  worth to buy it, but bad experience from the service centre they don't have trained  mechanic to resolve the issue  even they don't know how to adjust chain , i have done more than 3 long rides each ride covered more than 1000km .

Spectacular machine ,"Hey there,The buying experience of this bike was fantastic as the bajaj sales team was incredibly helpful and they provided me every kind of help that i needed. My riding experience on this bike is great i have ridden more than 9000 kms on this spectacular machine ( 9167 to be accurate). As looks are personal choice and it varies from person to person so i can’t comment on it but as far as my liking i love the way it looks so it’s absolutely an amazing looker, and the headlamp on this bike is amazing. The performance of this bike is good its far better that the ktm 200 series but it is not more powerful than the ktm 390 series. This bike does not have any issue regarding the vibrations (they are there but very much lesser than the 390s) and the heating problem. I also own a ktm rc 390 2017 model but it vibrates and heats alot but dominar is not like that. The power delivery is linear and more than enough for our Indian roads. As far as service is considered the bajaj service is good in my locality and the service cost is also not much, till now i have got 2 services and both time my experience was good. So there are some of the pros and cons which i found while riding it:-Pros....1. Comfortable 2. Agility 3. Road presence 4. Headlamp 5. Split instrument cluster 6. Reliability 7. Spares availability 8. Mileage (20-28kmpl)9. Brakes ( 320mm front disk, 230mm rear disk with dual channel abs)10. Usability Cons....1. No gear position indicator 2. Lesser power than 390s3. Weak side stand 4. No centre stand At last i love this bike so much Thanks.",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Royal enfield is the past. Go hyper riding ,"I own a midnight blue dominar, 400, abs since January 2017. After a year i can safely say it is an amazing bike. Well done bajaj! For people looking to buy Pros : Beefy look Sheer power Very responsive Comfortable seating position unlike other 350+cc bikes Slipper clutch Haven't seen a better headlamp. All led Cons:No gear indicator After market rear view mirror will be required A better windshield would have helped Mileage:28-30 kmpl in city 30-34 kmpl on highways Ride quality:Looks bulky but easy to navigate through heave traffic as well.Highway ride is an experience by itself. It is sheer power in your hands.Service and maintenance:Haven't found major issues with bajaj service centre that i visit.Conclusion:I am in love with this bike, good buy for people looking for a tourer with daily commute as well. Royal enfield is past. Go hyper riding :)",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018

Best bike bad buying experience,"I am owning this bike from July 27 2018, upgraded from pulsar 180, 1. My buying experience is the worst i ever had purchasing anything, i have given 5 * for the bike not the store,The store people didn't even bothered about providing the status about the vehicle at any point of time. I had to run behind for everything. They don't care what you buy. I planned for the bike for 3 months, and everything broke of due to those idiots in working in store 2. Riding experience is really awesome, i use this as my regular commuter , i have clocked 500 kms now, i am not a racer but the bike can tops upto 110km till the rpm limiter kicks in. The big wheel base gives a good stability while driving. 3. Looks is so stunning. Everyone's head turns for this bike while i drive around, the aoh is pretty awesome that's makes the bike so special, i bought the canyon red, its so gorgeous to have that colour,  first i was planning for the black variant once i saw the red couldn't take it off my thought and ended up buying the red and i will suggest anyone blindly go for that colour if u planning for this bike, performance u cannot complaint anything in this bike. Its heavy obviously, i am 165cm height and i am ok with the height, while driving there is no problems and while in traffic and signal a little bit difficult to handle, the weight. Performance is better to drive no need to drive faster its the long drive so we can drive and enjoy the open air. 4. I haven't given my bike for maintenance so no idea about that will update once i done it on next review 5.

Bajaj dominar 400  the beast..,"I have riding this bike for about 2 months actually i never owned it but my friend give me it every time to ride. I was stunned by the performance, the style , the looks and the acceleration.. It was the best bike i ever rode one. It was comfortable while riding and it's has no cons but has plenty of pros. This bike has a nice single cylinder 373cc engine which has a good power in terms of acceleration also the sound of the engine is too god especially better than a ktm duke 390 which gives you a feel of an autorikshaw and heats up easily but dominar 400 does not heats up. It seems to be inspired by the ducati diavel and the full led headlights got an heart from me...  Its mileage is also nice and about the performance the dominar roars like a lion in the jungle i love this bike so much i can't explain and with the abs it's stealing the hearts of every rider in such a reasonable price...Even with the 183 kilogram bulk and the kicked out forks, the dominar 400 is easy to hustle around the city. The turning radius isn’t great, though the light steering makes it easy to operate at slow speeds and while taking a u-turn. Through the twisties, the dominar 400 felt easy to tip in with the wide handlebar and round profile tyres helping its cause. However, the dominar 400 doesn’t respond well to mid-corner bumps which again cause the front end to judder, making you wish for a more forgiving suspension setup. North of 4,500rpm, the dominar 400 has its fair share of vibrations on the footpegs, tank, seat and to some extent, the handlebar. When you are cruising on the highway, the engine is always buzzing and i often found myself searching for another gear even though i was already in sixth. The vibrations smoothen out after 8,000rpm, but then you have a really small window before the limiter cuts in at 9,500rpm.I have always liked the way bajaj configures its brakes, and the dominar 400 is no different. While it doesn’t have the strong initial bite that we have seen on the pulsar range, this suits the dominar 400’s character. Knowing that you have abs watching your back goes a long way in inspiring confidence. However, the abs cannot be turned off.The dominar 400’s exhaust note has different levels to it, discreet at low revs and loud when you rev it hard. The dominar 400 also is the only motorcycle in the segment to feature a led headlamp, which works brilliantly.It gets a fancy multi-function ‘reverse lcd’ dash above the handlebar and a secondary display showing basic functions on the fuel tank. The dash looks lovely, but the backlight is a little too bright for night riding. The tachometer reads till 13,000rpm, but the limiter kicks in at 9,500rpm – meaning the entire vertical element of the tacho is redundant. The dominar 400 borrows several bits from its stable mates; the mirrors are from pulsar ns200, indicators from the ktm 200 duke and so on. There is a marked improvement in the level of finish and quality of components. The metallic paint finish and the alloy wheels add a premium touch to the motorcycle.",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
Dominar 400 abs,"Bike is in very mint/brand new condition and driven only 9,292 km and aided with bumper to bumper zero depreciation insurance and also fitted with aftermarket silencer and other accessories.

With zero maintenance charges, its a power house bike, with excellent braking, powerful headlight, wider tyre, superb handling,its never feel under power under any circumstances.

Can dominate the roads and the your pockets too!!!...,"I wasn't sure about picking it between the himalayan and the dominar 400, i was also on the verge of getting a duke 250 but the weight ratio and power made me to choose the d400 considering couple of its safety and the service center availability. The bike rides good has vibration issues when you cross 6-6.5 rpm, but which has drastically reduced after the ecu update recently. The mileage on this bike is not the best when you can expect around 30-33kmpl when you ride at 95-100kmph. And 28-30kmpl when you go upto 110kmph  and 26-28kmol when you go beyond 115kmph.",4,pos,bikewale,25-03-2019
Beauty  and  the beast ,"Buying  experience :I got this beautiful machine as my birthday  gift from my dad this year.From that day i enjoyed  my every single ride.Riding  experience :Great riding quality from my beauty, i enjoyed  every  single 'km' i have ridden.Looks and performance:It's muscular and heavy weight  suits me very well for my body  and performance  is absolutely  pure  for long rides,better bike for long tours with healthy budget,it can do easily a triple digit speed for a stretchy rides without any issue.Servicing and maintenance:Service at dealership is not so good,they need to know  about how  treat a above quarter litre engines this was the reason  i'm giving 4/5 for my review Pros and cons:Comfortable riding  experience, value  for money,decent  mileage,etc. Talking about the cons,vibrations vibrations it was  the major thing  every  dominar owner feels bad in this  bike, the rear brake could get improved for better braking experience That's it for my point of view.

Must read before you buy high-end motorcycle,"1. I bought a minimal used dominar. Wanted to buy a bike above 300cc and my budget was 2-3lakhs. My options were new apache 310rr, bmw 310r, dominar 400 used gt650r,ninja 300, harley street 750, beneli 300, continental gt. My only concern in the beginning was powerful and stylish later started to think wisely. I ride bike in city, highway, sometime off-road, sometimes show off. After spending 2-3lakhs i expect my bike to cross 160kmph on odo. I didn't go to gt650r because after paying so much i don't want to buy something that gets outdated very soon and invite pain to source it's parts. I didn't choose apache 310rr because this bike can never be a primary bike. ( it's purely to show off ) bwm delayed it launch and no clue abt it's service yet (didn't find any other good reason except brand name)Ninja definitely a good bike but one has to really rich to maintain it, so ruled out. Harley davidson is worth for it's price. Will buy it some day for sure. But definitely it can't be a daily runner and can't park where ever we get space. It deserves much care and respect.Worried abt benelli for it's service and parts. Ruled out continental gt (show off bike) i didn't go wrong in choosing dominar wisely. Can use it as a daily runner, long rides, can easily modify to proper tourer and off roader when required. Great macho looks, powerful, low maintenance compare to all other bikes i mentioned above. Great stability and road grip. Very good built quality, not to worry abt service and parts. Will not get outdated because no competitor for this segment. And the best thing was i could get used dominars at very good price.2.Very powerful, stable with metzelers tyres, good top speed, good riding position, feels light while riding, best head lights, handling is good. Head turner for sure.3.Some people say it lacks a character. It may not fall into particular category of bike. I rejected all the bike above that has characters because i don't have much space and  money to spend on multiple bikes with multiple characters. I want one to satisfy all my needs. If i have plenty of money, time and space. I will own cafe racer, dirt bike, super sports, street bike, tourer, classic etc for my different needs. It has a shape that can easily b converted to any character above except classic. Best performance for it's price and to suit different purpose 4.Higher than commuter bikes. But much cheaper than any other bike above 300cc5. Pros- style, versatility, fuel efficiency, value for money, big bike feel, torque, easy to maintain, built quality, powerful engine, comfortable riding position, powerful automatic led headlight, abs, slipper, clutch, best suspension, fit and finish, paint quality, longer and thicker front forks, bigger disk brake, wider rear wheel, wider handle bar, oil cooled engine Cons - small capacity fuel tank, single cylinder engine, not good exhaust note, don't have much good colour options, weight, rear end, tail light and tank dynamics look similar to pulsar. Higher rpm vibrations.",5,pos,bikewale,25-08-2018
A true power cruiser,"1.Simply put one of the best day in last year. Bajaj executives and agents@todupuzha were very well behaved and customer friendly.Could not expect better.2.I am satisfied with the bike.Even though the seating position is not cruiser style it won't b giving much backache.I have kept the stepped shock absorber in maximum hard setting. Hard setting is better in good roads.Better control and less back pain in my opinion.3.I think it has got best looks .At first sight i knew i have to buy this bike.Being sold as power cruiser dominar has got it's own segment.Most of the performance issues i had were fixed in latest ecu update.U have to shift gears more often for a smooth riding experience.Some may not like it.4.It has got a good service interval of 5000kms. You don't have to worry about a thing.There is little or no need for tightening etc.U must apply chain lubricant often.A single application lasts upto 250 km's.Otherwise there will be squeaky noise.For me the mileage ranges from 27 to 34 km's/l5. Pros-what they say in all the ads are true.Cons-bit plasticity, the digital console and headlights are not waterproof.Part of the display won't b legible in rain due to the mist inside and u have to wait until it's dry and it's never clear for me.Turning radius is high at low speeds. But can lean with confidence at high speeds thus reducing the turning radius.Exhaust pipe will always will have a rusty appearance.Its dirt and it's difficult to remove. The very next day it will be back after cleaning.6 th gear need minimum 60kms speed.But u will get a speed ticket at 50kmphr in kerala.",5,pos,bikewale,25-07-2018
Dominar best buy in its range,Dominar is the best looking bike in its segment. I own the matte black edition and it looks stunning. My experience with the bike has been more on the positive sides. I have used the bike daily and also made a 500km trip from delhi. The bike is comfortable. The riding posture is good. The bike doesn't feel heavy while riding but in heavy traffic you might need a bit of extra muscles. The bike is really supportive in long tours as well. If you are no re fan you will not get a better deal than dominar currently in India. On the negative side the pillion seat is not comfortable. The heating of engine might be felt during standing position. There no gear indicator. Do not visit small service centres for any query or service they are not aware of the technicalities. Try visiting the bigger service centres they have well trained mechanics on this particular bike.,4,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
The era of the power cruiser ,"<p>After riding quite a few bikes owned by friends for a couple of years ,reading bike magazines and  watching countless videos on you-tube  i  was ready to purchase my very first bike </p><p>I wanted to make sure i bought a bike which is  perfect for doing just anything ,</p><p>It was tough to find a bike in the mid segment without a few downsides to it , although i liked the ktm and royal enfield they were just too many of them on the streets , i needed a bike which was  different from the others ,performed  well in any condition without compromising reliability and comfort </p><p>So i made up my criteria's </p><p>1. Performance </p><p>2. Practicality </p><p>3. Touring </p><p>4. Unique design </p><p>5. Everyday use </p><p>Just when i was looking for a bike which ticks all my boxes , bajaj launched the dominar 400 . This looked very promising and the value for money was just too good. </p><p>Dominar had all the 5 things i ever wanted in my bike ,so without any hesitation i bought the bike in the very first batch </p><p>So i have used the bike on a daily basis averaging about 30 -40kms a day with quite a few long distance rides and  i must say the experience has been exceptional and totally worth every penny.</p><p>Coming to the looks , the dominar is a  visual treat and turns heads wherever you go even after 8 months of it being launched , the day time running lights makes it look unique on the road and it can be noticed from 1 km away . Many people even think of this as either expensive or  imported  .You get a lot of enquiries about your'e bike which makes you feel good about your bike </p><p>Coming to the performance , it has a very different engine , and the feeling is like no other , very smooth and refined which also  doesn't heat a lot in city traffic . </p><p>It feels at home on the highways and twisties , it feels very nimble and agile on any road ,very easy to handle  control and filter through the traffic in the city  .  Abs ,  mrf tyres and slipper clutch is the icing  on the cake  </p><p>About service and maintenance , the best part is bajaj service centres are there in most parts of the country which is good news if your'e  a tourer </p><p>Service is average and not that commendable , costs an average of 1500 per service </p><p>Pros - </p><p>1. Its an all-rounder , beast in the city and on the highways </p><p>2. Seating posture </p><p>3. Looks unique and value for money </p><p>Cons -</p><p> 1  jerks and minute vibrations in the lower rpms </p><p> 2.Suspension isn't up to the mark </p><p> 3. Cant handle bad roads </p>",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
A perfect 400cc bike,"So, for a middle class family thinking of buying a bike with 400cc bike was very big deal but due to this bike it has become easy for buying a 4000cc bike and i had used this bike in all road conditions including off roading for almost 40 km. So, after these all my experiences i can assure that this bike is the best and budget friendly bike ever also its first servicing cost is only 1300 which is less as compared to other 400cc bikes . The riding experience is very comfortable and also it doesn't heat much so it is also good for riding in traffic. The 1st servicing was hassle-free  due to bajaj service center and also they fully serviced my bike in 2 hrs which saved a my time. So hats off to bajaj for giving this bike.",5,pos,bikewale,25-10-2018
Dominar can be much better,"Nice bike but so much vibration and the service center don't services the bike properly, but i think it is proper for long rider who loves to do long rides, off roading and wants speed. If you are a rider who is a lover of speed then you can go for rc390 which is best for short rider and long rider.",4,pos,bikewale,25-11-2018
love the dominar,"The dominar 400 is the best bike.The bike have so much power for riding on hill station that's I love this and having so much balancing on short turns so this is not a bike for me it is like a gf for me.but the one problem is there in this bike is vibrating the plastic.if any one think to buy this bike then please take one ride before you take, I definitely say that you fall in love with this bike. in my group 5 dominar 400 are there all are having so much fun on this bike.",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
My sweet devil..,"I purchased dominar 400 as i love daily short rides as well as long rides... As a beginner it doesn't cause me any trouble at all..... It's also a good beginner friendly bike as well as an experienced rider's bike..... Has a good lower and top end's....And a good but some vibraring top end...... The bike is so responsive to throttle.... And has a good breaking capacity with the additional safety of abs.... Comparing to other 400 cc segment bikes, mileage is so satisfying which gives me 35-38 km in highways and around 32 in city.... I appreciate bajaj for making this wonderful 400 cc bike and also making this bike so affordable at this segment.... And also slipper clutch is so helpful and also riding position and seating comfort for me as a six foot tall is superb....",4,pos,bikewale,25-02-2019
Domi-n-awe!!,"Everything majestic. It's bajaj! it's heritage as well as performance.

A proud owner of pulsar for 14 yrs, and now with this beautiful machine.",5,pos,bikewale,25-06-2018
Damn beauty,This is a super beast at this price bracket and the trust on bajaj company has made of a very truthful purchase .

living with the dominar 400 2018 edition,"The 2018 edition of dominar colours are just awesome and the rock matte black one is the best its on you which colour you like but i loved the matte black colour and got one for me. The buying experience was just like a dream for me as it was my dream to buy a bike since i was in 8th and which bike would be better than dominar. starting with the cons the first thing i realized was that its an heavy bike and pushing it in reverse is a hard job but once its start moving  we don't feel the weight. the second con is that missing gear indicator but once you get use to bike that's not a problem. the third con is the mileage i personally think mileage could have been better. now the pros the bike is full of pros. the best value for money bike. the abs works good. the Cooling system is best, the led front light are the best on this bike than any other bike.even the led indicators are good. all this make this bike look like a real beast.",5,pos,bikewale,25-04-2018
value for money package,"Mainly the Dominar beats  cbr250,rs200, classic 350,mojo, Himalayan .I have compared these motorcycle with Dominar because price of all these bikes are near touch.buying Dominar over these motorcycle makes more sense. dominar has more power ,good equipment, everything just for a little extra price over the above motorcycles. 
1.CBR250-costs more than Dominar even with less features.so Dominar is winner
2.RS200-giving a little more money gives Dominar which has good speed, acceleration,dual ABS,best lights ,good brakes.so Dominar makes more sense.
3.CLASSIC 350-re350 is overpriced for what it gives, probably greese monkeys loves to have one just because of its looks,but they really don't know what other company offers for that price.and most Indian people believe CC is power.here just by little extra price bajaj gives you everything,BEATS RE350 IN EVERY WAY.
4.MOJO- this doesn't gives as features and power when compared with Dominar and mojo doesn't feels well priced(value for money package) so Dominar offer better and it's the winner
5.HIMALAYAN-this bike is better than classic 350 but even doesn't comes near to bajaj Dominar. himalayan is overpriced.and lacks many features and refinement when in comparison with Dominar
totally Dominar is best of both worlds along with value for money package which I have ever seen on a motorcycle industry.SO BOLD,SO CHEAP,SO MUCH FEATURES,AND MOST POWERFUL BIKE IN COMPARISON WITH THESE FIVE BIKES.",5,pos,bikewale,25-10-2018
Beyond expectations and best in everything,"It's amazing how bajaj could mould up such a beast of a machine.Comparing to its austrian cousin the ktm, it may lack that punch, but it's a power cruiser.For those who are still baffled about how it fares or lack trust in bajaj, i can assure you this is beyond your imaginations.1. Abs- those of you who doesn't know what an abs is or doesn't believe in that mechanism, i suggest you to hit up the internet and watch a few videos about the same.For 1.86 lakh you would never find any other motorcycle with a good 'life saving feature'.2. Headlamps : it's the best in it's class range.Visibility, distance everything, it's a blessing for long drives at night.It distinct itself from the hydrogen yellow lamp vehicles.3. Looks - heard of the ducati diavel want a motorcycle inspired from the big machine. Go on..The dominar 400 is best for you.4. Power & riding - riding a power cruiser with 36 bhp of power, will give you an edge over others at the road. The power is apt, top speed upto 150+, the seats are good except for the pavilion seat.The showroom guys had been great in educating me about the various aspects of the motorcycle.Being rather pessimistic about bajaj i had my thoughts about checking on this bike.But after many a positive reviews, i decided to check on this machine. Boy! it didn't disappoint me.For such a price range, you would never even dream of getting a better motorcycle than dominar 400.For those who are still confused, you can still check upon the trans-odessey trip that dominar 400 had completed.The first motorcycle to do so and that too without any complaints.It's a rider's dream.If you want looks? yes.You want power? yes.You want that punch? yes, but dont compare it with a racing gene motorcycle such as ktm. You want safety? you have abs!!After all these years, i am glad that a company had come up with a product valuing customer's money, appeal, rights, values etc.There may have been areas where bajaj could improve on the motorcycle.Such as high rpm closure, maybe the tyres but the positives are many, comparing to the rare negatives of the motorcycle.The console is great only lacking a gear position indicator, but you have the rest of it. So no big deal.Even after 15000+ kms the motorcycle has not failed me in it's reliability.For my first services, not many service centres had the personnel and equipment for the motorcycle But now the motorcycle is familiar in the Indian roads, so that's not a problem for me nowadays.Functionality : yes Reliability : yes Value for money : yes Conclusion.The motorcycle is the best in value. If you want something for power, safety, appeal or so..Then you can opt for the dominar 400.You wouldn't know unless you try!!",4,pos,bikewale,25-05-2018
Review,"Not yet bought, planning to buy. I have visited 2 showrooms, Honda cbr250r and bajaj dominar 400. Both are amazing. Now confused which one to buy as performance and look wise both are good. Price is amazing for dominar which is giving higher power than Honda. Which made me thought again and shall go with dominar 400.",5,pos,bikewale,25-09-2018
Detailed review of proud owner,"Buying a Dominar 400 is surely a hassle free business considering you're paying in complete one time payment. I am unaware how the loan functionality works so I won't comment on it. 
As far as Riding Purpose is considered, if you are someone who's picking a bike to rip, then please spare the machine and take a Duke 390. This bike is surely no monster when it comes to performance, but it sure is an all rounder - take it for a Highway Spin or Take It in Breathless Traffic Conditions in the City, IT JUST WON'T GIVE UP AS EASILY AS A DUKE 390, And so is a very reliable machine. Yes it does heat up like it's KTM Cousin, but thanks to the heat flow structure of the Dominar - You won't have Free Leg Waxing as the Duke 390. Cooling Fan Directs the Flow to The Belly Pan, and Hence Minimal Heat is Felt at the Foot area. 
The DOMINAR isn't a Racer, but yes it surely is a Back Friendly Cruiser/Highway Roller. There's a special exhaust note when you're accelerating through the rev range of 2000-6000rpm where you hear a sweet hum of the Engine (I find it melodic), post 6000Rpm it still pulls superb till the Bajaj Restricted 9500Rpm mark where it is forced to lose steam. So yes, A Perfect All-Rounder for your Office Commutes or Your Weekend Rides. As a matter of fact, I've owned the Duke 390 2016 too, and oh boy! the seats are comfortable AF on The Dominar - No Sore Butts (for neither rider nor pillion). 
Equipped with Uniquely Styled LED HEADLAMPS, IT IS A HEAD-TURNER! So what if it doesn't have the snazzy Orange and White like it's cousin, it looks Spankingly Amazing in the Bronze Red/Blue/Black Combo. 
Prior to buying, Many Had Told Me Dominar is A Vibration Machine... I Must Say, It Is All Bullshit.
THERE ARE NO SUCH IRRITATING VIBRATIONS. 
it is obvious that if a part is not fastened properly in its place, it may give vibrations. BUT IT SURELY ISN'T AS BAD WITH VIBES AS FAR AS THE DUKE 390 IS CONCERNED. Nor is it like Riding a 2-Wheeled Blast Furnace (referred to Duke 390). 
There is one area that Bajaj can surely improve on, and that is either to unleash more from the Rev Range, or just not show a False Rev Range on ODO going higher than 10000RPM. The Space Above 10K RPM is just Redundant! It seems like a Gear Indicator Could have done better justice in that useless space. 
I However Like the Way The Bike is Shaped. Yes it isn't the Lightest in its Class, but it sure is the Firmly Stuck To The Ground Machine in the Same Class... Crosswinds is a piece of cake for the Dom to handle, and Thus is The perfect all round package of Looks, Performance, Stability and Comfort. 
It's Wrong To Expect it to Clock Speeds of 160kmph or above considering the Price Tag it is offered at for the Features You Get. Yes, Lot Many People May Complain that ABS is Full Time ON, But then, wouldn't it be better to have a Safety Feature ON to save your life than have the Option to Lock Your Wheel Instead. 
As Far As Servicing is Concerned - You're taking a Made In India Machine - Made for India too, so Service Costs are nothing to tie you down from buying it. Value for Money Investment and Service Cost too (Rs.1000-1500 per Service). YES, the bike needs regular Chain Care (Lube and Clean every 500kms), after-all that's the main driver for the Rear Wheel from the Engine Mill. Maintain your Chain, And You'll Be Happy With The Bike's Overall Performance. I haven't really found the Headlights as Bad as Many may have Quoted, but I believe the Experience would vary from person to person. 
Pros: Price Tag, Build Quality, Performance, Cooling System, Seat Comfort, ABS, Styling, Split Dash Concept, Fuel Economy. 
Cons: Absence of Gear Indicator, Rev Range Shown to Go to 12-13000rpm But Goes Only Till 9500Rpm (waste of display space), Absence of Average Fuel Consumption or Range or RESERVE FUEL INDICATOR. 
Being my 3rd Bike (previously owned a Kawasaki Ninja 250 and A KTM Duke 390 '16), to all those thinking of buying the Dominar 400 - GO FOR IT!
