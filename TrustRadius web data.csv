Webex Meetings is the best way to organize and manage your meetings," Webex  Meetings  is  being  used  by  our  entire  organization.  I  can  easily  say  that ""it s"",  almost  a  default  tool  for  our  daily  communication.  We  use  it  to  communicate  not  only  with  our  colleagues  from  different  regions  within  the  company;  but  also  with  suppliers  or  service  providers  from  outside  the  company.  We  use  it  to  schedule  meetings  and  share  information  during  the  meetings,  and  to  broadcast  information  or  to  review  status.  As  a  summary,  it  is  one  of  the  most  useful  tools  that  have  been  used  so  far  within  our  organization. "," High-resolution  video  conferencing  and  a  variety  of  connectivity  options.  You  can  share  your  screen  or  annotate  other  user  screens  and  make  basic  controls.  You  can  make  video/audio  calls  via  landlines  or  internet  connection  through  your  device.  Audio  quality  is  most  of  the  times  good  and  robust.I  like  Webex  tools  and  add-ons  a  lot,  as  these  really  make  the  office  life  easier  for  me.  The  Outlook  add-on  tool  is  a  very  useful  feature.  You  can  simply  add  the  Web  Ex  link  to  your  invitations  or  launch  instant  or  scheduled  meetings  just  by  one  click  from  Outlook  add-on  button.  Another  good  tool  is  the  Webex  Productivity  tool  which  can  be  added  as  a  shortcut  to  your  desktop.  You  can  manage  all  your  agenda  and  organize  any  meetings  with  this  tool.You  can  also  have  most  of  these  features  on  mobile  versions  of  Webex  as  well. ""I m"",  using  the  i  OS  version  of  the  Webex  app  and  it  gives  me  all  the  flexibility  I  need  while ""I m"",  away  from  my  desk  or  during  business  travels.

These  give  you  the  power  to  have  an  efficient  meeting.You  can  record  meetings  and  trainings  and  save  them  for  use  later  on,  what  a  perfect  feature! "," Voice  quality  depends  on  your  connection  method.  If  you  are  using  a  headset  which  is  connected  to  your  IP  or  landline  phone;  then  the  outcome  is  almost  perfect.  However,  if ""you re"",  using  a  computer  to  dial  in,  the  voice  quality  depends  on  your  internet  speed.Probably  the  only  critical  issue  with  Webex  may  be  the  lag  after  sharing  your  screen  or  after  annotating  (taking  over)  other ""users "",  screen  for  a  long  time  period.The  Webex  interface  is  very  cool  and  simple  but  somehow  the  latest  version  can  cause  users  to  struggle  with  the  controls.Very  rarely,  Webex  servers  can  respond  slowly  or  give  no  response.  I  think  this  is  something  that  can  happen  with  any  service  providers,  so  I ""don t"",  see  it  as  an  issue.

I  can  record  meetings  for  those  that ""can t"",  attend,  or  even  conduct  meetings  away  from  my  desk  through  my  phone  or  tablet.  The  majority  of  my  vendors  use  Webex,  so ""it s"",  very  plug-and-play  when  sharing  content  and  information.

I  love  the  Exchange  plugin  that  allows  me  to  create  a  meeting  and  add  a  Webex  conference  call  within  the  invite.  Very  easy.  I  had  to  copy  and  paste  from  my  previous  provider.  Not  fun.Starting  a  meeting  is  great,  especially  if ""I m"",  not  the  first  one  on  the  call.

Anyone  can  take  control  of  the  presentation,  or  I  can  lock  it  down  as  needed.  I  can  also  put  people  on  mute  that  have  either  walked  away  from  their  desk  and  have  too  much  background  noise,  mute  those  that  are  driving  (annoying),  and  mute  those  that  think ""they re"",  on  mute.

"Not intuitive for all attendees, but with some simplification it has potential"," Webex  is  mostly  used  for  screen-sharing  purposes  for  1  or  more  users  during  a  traditional  conference  call.  The  problem  it  solves  is  by  providing  the  ability  to  share  something  visual  with  another  party,  such  as  walking  someone  through  a  presentation.  This  is  either  dictated  by  my  users  or  by  the  client.  We  have  4  host  accounts  for  users  who  need  to  schedule  their  own  meetings,  but  most  of  the  organization  has  attended  a  Webex  before  as  a  guest.

Amazing collaboration with Webex," Webex  is  being  used  across  my  organisation,  to  support  the  effective  communication  and  collaboration  between  team  members  based  remotely  across  different  countries.  Its  used  in  the  place  of  physical  meetings,  utilising  the  video  conferencing  functions  to  make  colleagues  feel  as  though  they  are  in  the  same  room  together.  Likewise,  collaborative  functions  such  as  enabling  meeting  recordings,  sharing  screens  for  mutual  viewing  and  the  ability  to  work  on  one  document  between  multiple  meeting  attendees  makes  project  management  and  monitoring  straightforward  for  us. "," Webex’s  visual  simplicity  and  ease  of  use  are  key,  as  not  all  colleagues  are  in  technical  roles,  and  encountering  challenges  in  joining  a  call,  sending  a  meeting  request  to  others,  or  sharing  their  content  would  discourage  them  from  using  this  tool  widely  and  thus  keeping  in  close  contact  with  their  remote  team  members.The  call  management  functions  make  it  easy  to  host  professional  presentations  to  large  internal  or  external  audiences,  as  well  as  smaller  team  meetings.  Call  hosts  can  mute  incoming  attendees  to  the  call,  create  a  panel  of  presenters  with  different  access  and  view  rights  to  attendees,  record  the  session,  enable  a  Q&A  panel  for  questions,  and  much  more. "," The  integration  with  the  Webex  Teams  app  occasionally  causes  confusion  when  joining  or  starting  a  meeting,  as  the  meeting  can  sometimes  automatically  launch  through  Webex  Teams,  as  well  as  through  Webex  itself  online  or  on  desktop.  This  can  lead  to  time  lost  at  the  start  of  a  meeting,  trying  to  figure  out  which  to  use  and  what’s  going  on.  It  would  be  better  to  limit  the  meeting  exclusively  to  one  or  the  other.An  advantage  of  using  Webex  is  that  colleagues  can  work  from  anywhere-  their  home  office  or  a  public  space.  Their  video  can  be  distracting  in  these  cases,  however,  drawing  attention  away  from  the  meeting.  It  would  therefore  be  beneficial  to  have  the  ability  to  set  a  background  scene  or  image  behind  the  user,  using  facial  recognition  technology.

"Webex - Nothing More (than its peers), Nothing Less (unless you skimped on your license)"," Webex  is  being  used  in  our  organization  primarily  for  online  meetings  that  involve  screen  share.  It  is  currently  being  phased  out  in  our  company  in  favor  of  Microsoft  Teams  Meeting.  Because  of  our  licensing  agreement  with  Webex,  only  a  portion  of  the  users  were  able  to  use  integrated  audio  as  well.  Most  users  only  have  access  to  the  screen  sharing  portion  and  telephony  was  handled  by  a  separate  conference  bridge. ", Webex  was  easily  accessible  throughout  the  org  for  meetings  -  the  integration  with  Outlook  was  pretty  good.Webex  did  a  good  job  with  screen  sharing  and  the  standard  webconference  (non-audio)  features.The  Webex  app  was  not  insignificant.  I  used  it  on  an  iphone  as  a  supplement  and  it  was  very  useful. ," Not  inherently  connecting  VOIP  with  the  screen  sharing  meant  (for  us)  that  we  always  had  to  wrangle  2  tools  to  start  a  meeting  rather  than  1.The  Webex  desktop  app  was  helpful,  like  the  mobile  app,  but  the  primary  experience  our  company  was  likely  sold  against  was  the  web  version.  That  is  the  weaker  of  the  3  platforms.Webex  recordings  were  very  difficult  to  make,  edit,  download  and  convert.  Simplicity  would  have  served  them  well.Attaching  a  dial  in  conference  bridge  (again,  because  of  our  licensing  model)  was  a  below  average  experience.

Webex Meetings is a great platform for remote collaborations and presentations," At  my  current  company,  Webex  Meetings  is  currently  used  for  large  meetings  that  need  to  include  employees  not  onsite,  sharing  content  with  external  collaborators,  or  sometimes  internally  to  screen  share.

Personally,  it  has  helped  to  include  employees  that  work  offsite  or  at  home  that  need  to  attend  group  meetings. "," Web  Ex  Meetings  enables  large  and  small  audience  meetings.  It  is  very  scalable.  It  can  be  an  interactive  meeting  with  3-5  attendees  or  a  webinar  with  over  100.The  host  can  configure  a  ton  of  options  for  the  meeting  so  that  it  can  run  smoothly.  i.e.  mute  all  attendees,  allow/disable  screen  sharing,  or  grant  access  to  specific  features  to  attendees.The  integration  with  Microsoft  Office,  especially  Outlook,  is  very  useful.  If  the  tools  are  installed,  a  Webex  meeting  can  be  created  and  added  to  a  scheduled  meeting  easily  at  the  same  time  as  scheduling  the  meeting.

"Traditional, Safe Choice, but Not Intuitive"," My  organization  used  Web  Ex  Meetings  for  much  of  our  video  and  audio  conferencing  needs,  both  within  the  organization  and  with  external  clients.  As  we  are  located  on  both  sides  of  the  country  and  our  clients  were  dispersed  across  the  US  and  overseas,  this  allowed  us  to  communicate  with  each  other  relatively  easily. "," The  calendar  on  the  platform  provides  a  good  visual  as  to  when  meetings  are  scheduled.  It  helps  when  we  are  scheduling  new  meetings  to  be  able  to  easily  see  when  meetings  are  already  scheduled  to  start  and  end,  so  we  can  avoid  double-booking.There  are  many  features  within  the  application,  including  the  ability  to  share  and  upload  files  to  present,  a  feature  we  used  often.

"," Sometimes  the  video  quality  goes  way  down  and  we  can  barely  see  the  faces  of  the  people  on  the  other  end.  This  may  have  to  do  with  the  internet  connectivity,  as  the  other  party  is  our  team  in  a  different  location,  and  we  know  they  use  the  same  (high  quality)  camera  all  the  time,  so ""it s"",  not  due  to  the  camera.We  upload  files  to  share  during  the  meetings,  and  it ""won t"",  take  certain  files.

Enabling Global Teams with WebEx, Currently  we  are  using  Web  Ex  Meetings  as  our  primary  tool  for  meetings  and  conferencing  both  internally  and  with  external  vendors  and  customers.  Prior  to  our  company  wide  Web  Ex  deployment  last  year  we  had  a  variety  of  tools  in  our  environment  for  phone  conferencing  and  remote  meetings.  Consolidating  down  to  one  solution  allowed  us  to  provide  a  very  stable  consistent  experience  around  the  globe  as  well  as  enabling  some  significant  cost  savings. ," Web  Ex  provides  attendees  with  several  options  for  connecting  to  meeting  audio  including  computer  headsets,  800  and  local  numbers  as  well  as  a  call  me  feature.  This  makes  it  easy  for  people  to  connect  no  matter  where  they  are  or  what  device  they  are  using  to  connect.In  our  experience  the  audio  and  video  streams  during  our  meetings  have  been  very  stable  and  smooth.  This  enables  very  effective  meetings  without  audio  or  video  interruptions  getting  in  the  way.Web  Ex  has  many  useful  features  that  enable  a  very  strong  meeting  experience.  Audio/Video,  Screen  Sharing  and  Whiteboard  just  to  name  a  few. ", During  our  initial  deployment  we  had  difficulty  installing  the  client  on  systems  which  already  had  a  previous  version  of  Web  Ex  installed.  There  was  no  Web  Ex  cleanup  utility  that  worked  properly  which  forced  us  to  write  our  own  to  clean  previous  versions  off  of  systems  prior  to  installing  a  new  client.The  Web  Ex  client  and  server  tends  to  update  very  frequently  which  introduced  difficulty  during  our  initial  deployment.  This  was  especially  true  with  our  associates  who  do  not  have  admin  rights  on  their  PC.Technical  support  during  the  packaging  and  deployment  stage  of  our  implementation  could  have  been  a  bit  better.  We  ended  up  creating  our  own  solutions  and  resolving  issues  frequently  where  Web  Ex  was  not  able  to. ,17-Jun-16,8 out of 10,Verified User,Administrator in Information Technology,Chemicals Company,"10,001+ employees"

Communication with Freedom of Location, We  are  in  the  process  of  rolling  out  Cisco  Jabber  to  our  enterprise  community.  We  have  been  piloting  it  for  quite  some  time  now  and  it  is  one  of  my  favorite  collaboration  tools  that  we  have  attempted  to  use  in  our  organization.  We  plan  to  provide  this  to  users  in  our  organization  that  currently  have  or  request  a  phone  line  for  business  purposes.  Our  users  will  have  the  flexibility  of  using  that  phone  line  on  either  a  Cisco  Jabber  client  or  on  the  client  and  a  physical  desk  phone.  The  problem  that  Cisco  Jabber  addresses  for  us  is  that  it  provides  the  ability  for  our  user  community  to  be  mobile  and  flexible  in  location  of  where  they  do  their  work  while  still  remaining  reachable  for  collaboration  with  others.  To  this  point  our  user  community  that  has  already  been  given  access  to  the  platform  is  very  satisfied  with  the  capability  to  communicate  with  the  tool.  Many  users  have  commented  to  us  that  they  wish  we  had  provided  this  capability  quite  some  time  ago.  Many  users  were  aware  that  the  product  existed  based  on  past  experience  with  another  employer  or  just  as  a  matter  of  having  researched  the  available  tools  for  collaboration  that  are  currently  popular. , The  Cisco  Jabber  client  allows  a  user  the  flexibility  of  location  while  still  being  available  to  anyone  for  collaboration  and  communication.  No  longer  tethered  to  a  desk  to  take  calls.  This  is  a  huge  benefit  in  my  mind  Cisco  Jabber  also  provides  presence  and  availability  status  without  even  needing  to  actually  call  or  send  a  message  to  someone  to  determine  availability.  This  saves  a  ton  of  time  from  wasted  effort  trying  to  find  someone  and  learn  if  they  are  available  to  collaborate.When  configured  correctly  Cisco  Jabber  can  also  be  integrated  with  some  calendaring  systems  to  automatically  update  the  status  of  a  user. , There  is  some  brand  confusion  that  exists  between  Cisco  communication  products.  This  is  more  relevant  to  the  support  personnel  and  engineers  that  would  be  making  decisions  to  implement  the  product.  Cisco  has  their  Spark/Web  Ex  platform  that  provides  collaboration/communication  functionality  and  more  to  the  end  users.  Cisco  has  stated  at  some  conferences  that  I  attended  that  they  are  committed  to  maintaining  and  developing  the  Cisco  Jabber  platform  still  so  that  is  very  promising  since  the  product  serves  different  needs.Cisco  Jabber  is  a  little  complex  to  implement  properly  in  your  environment.  The  larger  the  communication  cluster  the  more  complicated  it  can  become.  There  are  also  some  additional  features  like  persistent  chat  that  require  extra  resources  like  a  standalone  database  for  persistent  chat. ,9-Aug-18,9 out of 10,Eric Taylor,VoIP Network Administrator,Higher Education,"10,001+ employees"
Great platform for interoffice communication," Jabber  is  available  and  used  by  almost  everyone  in  our  organization.  It  is  used  to  communicate  between  staff  and  attorneys,  as  well  as  among  attorneys.  It  relieves  us  from  excessive  emails  and  allows  us  to  quickly  chat  on  work,  personal  and  other  matters  in  an  efficient  manner.

Jabber at the Office," Jabber  is  used  across  the  organization.  It  is  pretty  much  an  internal  communication  system  that  is  linked  to  the  telephone  system.  We  can  use  it  to  send  direct  and  instant  messages  (similar  to  a  chat  service),  make  phone  calls,  receive  calls,  send  and  receive  messages.

Great replacement for desk phones," We  use  Jabber  across  the  enterprise.  In  order  to  reduce  hardware  and  licensing  costs,  we  needed  a  solution  that  replaced  our  existing  use  of  Skype  for  Business;  integrated  into  a  Cisco  Vo  IP  solution,  allowed  remote  users  to  be  issued  a  direct  number,  and  provided  simple,  straightforward  instant  messaging.  From  our  cost-benefit  analyses,  Jabber  was  significantly  cheaper  than  similar  solutions  from  Skype  for  Business  or  Citrix,  and  because  of  its  integration  into  the  Cisco  UCS  environment,  it  was  easy  to  deploy  out  the  enterprise. "," Provides  unified,  simple  to  use  instant  messaging  across  departments,  groups,  and  projects.Makes  it  easy  for  users  to  move  from  their  mobile  phones  to  the  desktop  to  a  physical  phone.Presence  indicators  pull  nicely  from  Outlook  so  users ""don t"",  have  to  mark  themselves  as  being  in  a  meeting  or  otherwise  unavailable.

Jabbering Away on Cisco Jabber," Jabber  is  currently  being  used  by  my  whole  organization  as  an  internal  instant  messaging  tool.  It  is  helpful  because  it  is  tied  to  our  phone  services  and  we  can  see  when  someone  is  in  a  meeting  or  not  without  opening  up  Outlook.  It  also  cuts  down  on  the  amount  of  emails  we  send  since  we  can  have  real-time  conversations  about  an  issue  or  use  it  to  answer  quick  questions  that ""don t"",  really  need  an  email.  It  makes  communication  easier  and  more  efficient. ", It  integrates  phone  services  so  that  you  can  see  who  is  calling  and  even  dial  using  your  computer.

Jabber up a storm., Jabber  was  implemented  once  the  product  became  a  more  mature  solution  to  our  collaboration  needs.

Using Jabber to Blabber with your coworkers at a large non-profit," Our  entire  organization  of  approximately  500-600  employees  uses  jabber  very  often  on  a  daily  basis  as  our  primary  means  of  instant  communication.  Besides  e-mail,  we  use  jabber  in  our  organization  to  ask  urgent  questions,  notify  others  of  things  quickly  or  send  more  informal  messages  that  don’t  require  a  full  email  or  phone  call.  It  allows  us  to  communicate  much  more  effectively  because  our  employees  are  usually  busy  and  not  confined  to  their  office  or  desk,  so  if  they  miss  a  phone  call  it  becomes  very  easy  to  play  phone  tag  all  day.  Jabber  is  also  a  more  casual  form  of  sending  messages  you  may  not  want  to  send  in  an  e-mail,  and  allows  you  to  use  emojis  and  attachments  to  illustrate  your  point.

Dependable IP Telephone Access From Your Computer, My  company  utilizes  Jabber  throughout  the  entire  organization.  It  gives  us  a  mechanism  for  communication  throughout  our  organization  both  via  voice  and  video  calls  and  by  way  of  instant  messaging. ," My  favorite  use  of  Jabber  is  for  making  and  receiving  phone  calls  from  my  PC.  For  outgoing  calls  I  can  search  through  the  corporate  database  of  employees  to  select  my  recipient  and  call  right  from  my  computer.  All  incoming  calls  ring  both  on  my  desk  phone  and  on  my  PC,  allowing  me  to  receive  a  call  using  my  headset  and  microphone  even  when ""I m"",  working  remotely.Jabber  provides  a  unified  platform  for  sending  instant  messages  to  any  employee  within  our  organization.Jabber  displays  the  availability  of  each  employee.  The  fact  that  it  syncs  up  with  our  company  calendars  makes  this  feature  useful  for  determining  if  an  employee  is  currently  in  a  meeting.

This  could  of  course  be  attributed  to  our ""company s"",  network  infrastructure  but ""I ve"",  not  had  many  connectivity  problems  otherwise.Some  versions  of  Jabber  display  ""toast""  messages  every  time  a  user  comes  online.  This  is  rather  annoying  and  although  they  provided  a  mechanism  for  silencing  these  toasts,  its  on  a  per-user  basis  and  it  is  not  intuitively  obvious  how  to  silence  them.

Jabber for efficient communication," Jabber  is  used  by  most  of  our  company. ""It s"",  great  for  a  variety  of  reasons.  Our  offices  are  located  all  over  the  country,  so  if  you  have  a  quick  question  and ""don t"",  want  it  to  get  buried  under  emails,  you  can  just  jabber  someone  in  New  York  or  Michigan  and ""they ll"",  reply  quickly.

Jabber keeps you connected when you move throughout the day," As  far  as  I  know,  it  is  being  used  across  the  whole  organization.  Anyone  who  is  logged  into  a  computer  and  has  an  extension  is  able  to  use  it.  I  think  it  gives  more  means  of  communication  to  help  connect  the  campuses.  This  is  a  community  college  that  has  several  campuses  spread  out  across  central  PA,  so  having  varying  forms  of  communication  across  these  is  important.  It  also  helps  with  staff/faculty  who  move  offices  and  are  not  always  at  a  phone  with  their  extension.  They  are  able  to  use  Jabber  to  check  voicemail,  for  example. "," Jabber  adds  a  good  chat  element  of  communication,  which  is  not  available  with  other  technology  or  software  that ""I ve"",  seen  here  on  campus.  This  is  nice  for  quick  questions  with  someone  that  you ""don t"",  want  to  bother  with  a  phone  call,  but  are  hoping  for  a  quick  response  (faster  than  email).Another  perk  is  the  ability  to  see  if  you  are  receiving  a  phone  call.  If  you  have  a  microphone  and  headphones  set  up,  you  can  even  answer  it  from  your  computer,  you ""don t"",  have  to  be  right  by  your  phone  at  all  times.And  my  favorite  is  that  you  can  see  your  voicemail  from  Jabber.  You  can  see  if  you  have  one  and  also  listen  to  it  if  you  have  speakers/headphones.  This  way  you ""don t"",  have  to  wait  to  get  to  your  phone  the  next  day  to  hear  any  voicemail  you  may  get  when  you  are  at  another  location  away  from  your  main  phone. "," I  think  it  could  be  clearer  how  to  log  out  of  it.  I  can  click  on  it  to  get  in,  but  then  it  just  stays  open,  even  if  I  close  the  box.  There  is  a  pop  out  from  the  top  of  my  screen  that  stays.  I  think  a  clearer  log-off  button  on  the  box  would  be  helpful.Is  there  a  mobile  application  for  this?

They  make  you  update  the  software  by  not  allowing  you  to  skip.My  Jabber  was  not  able  to  connect  me  directly  to  the  conference  call.  I  had  to  join  in  using  the  actual  phone.  This  could  be  a  problem  just  for  my  company  though.Group  messaging  was  hard.  Every  time  I  had  to  add  the  participants.

IM Disappointed," Jabber  is  being  used  across  the  entire  organization  for  IM,  presence,  click-to-call,  click-to-email,  and  voicemail.  It  addresses  the  need  to  communicate  with  others  in  a  different  part  of  the  building,  country,  or  world.  It  is  important  to  know  whether  or  not  a  person  is  available  based  on  their  presence.  If  they  are  offline,  or  in  a  meeting,  or  not  at  their  desk,  Jabber  will  tell  you  their  presence.  It  can  also  be  used  as  an  alternative  to  the  desk  phone  for  checking  voicemails,  which  is  convenient  if  someone  is  not  at  their  desk. "," Instant  Messaging  Presence  Contact  details  (phone,  email,  etc.) "," Does  not  keep  track  of  conversation  history. ""Can t"",  see  what  I  said  yesterday  to  a  person.  This  is  really  important,  since  people  communicate  important  info  to  one  another,  and  that  can  just  disappear,  requiring  another  round  of  communication.  Would  be  better  to  just  scroll  up  in  history  like ""competitors "",  tools  do.No  chat  rooms,  must  manually  add  members  to  group  chat  each  time.  No  notion  of  teams/named  groups,  only  individuals.Does  not  automatically  log  in  to  Web  Ex,  prompts  for  a  log  in  each  time.Difficult  to  set  a  profile  picture,  so  people  see  a  gray  outline  instead  of  my  face.  I  think  this  is  coming  from  my  pic  in  Active  Directory,  but  I  should  be  able  to  customize  it  like  with  other  apps.Overall  lack  of  features.  It  comes  from  Cisco,  so  all  the  integrations  have  to  do  with  phones  and  voicemail.  I ""don t"",  have  a  need  for  this  in  my  IM  client,  since  I  do  not  use  my  work  phone  at  all.  So  it  does  a  really  poor  job  at  the  only  thing  I  use  it  for.  I  have  stopped  using  it  recently,  since  everyone  I  need  to  talk  to  frequently  is  on  Hip  Chat,  which  my  company  also  uses.  This  is  bad,  since  all  the  people  who  use  Jabber  and  not  Hip  Chat  see  me  as  offline  even  though  I  am  available.Jabber  is  very  cumbersome  to  use,  since  I  only  use  it  for  IM,  and ""it s"",  missing  many  features  that  a  client  that  focused  specifically  on  IM  would  provide,  such  as  group  chat,  chat  rooms,  and  message  history.Cannot  send  attachments  to  offline  recipients.Very  limited  ability  for  rich  content:  Cannot  display  images  in  IM  text,  cannot  use  emojis/stickers  or  add  custom  emoticons.

Why just chat when you can Jabber!," Jabber  is  a  huge  collaboration  tool  in  our  environment.  It  is  not  just  a  simple  chat  window  for  us  to  remotely  chat,  but  it  is  also  a  great  tool  to  show  availability.  We  also  use  the  share  desktop  feature  a  lot  to  collaborate  and  troubleshoot.

Recent  chats,  meetings,  and  contacts  are  easy  to  find  and  easy  to  modify.  I  love  how  the  meetings  have  a  link  into  the  Web  Ex  part  so  you ""don t"",  even  have  to  go  into  Outlook  to  reach  it.The  Mobile  app  is  a  great  way  to  reach  someone  after  hours  for  emergencies.

Jabber- Great for Messaging and Desktop Sharing," Jabber  is  being  used  as  our ""company s"",  instant  messaging  tool,  connecting  team,  departments,  and  the  entire  organization  in  a  useful  alternative  to  email.  Like  email  it  provides  an  asynchronous  means  of  sending  and  receiving  messages  in  a  less  disruptive  manner  than  phone,  or  face  to  face  conversations.  Additionally  with  the  availability  status  it  is  easy  to  know  if  a  coworker  is  in  the  office.  Finally,  Jabber  has  an  excellent  feature  that  allows  you  to  share  your  desktop  with  another  user,  and  even  grant  control.  This  facilitates  collaboration  and  even  IT  help  desk  support  as  you  can  view  users  desks  remotely. "," Jabber  is  excellent  for  remote  troubleshooting  as  it  allows  remote  desktop  sharing  and  even  control.  It  is  very  easy  to  setup  a  sharing  session-  literally  seconds-  even  for  non  technical  users.  This  can  be  used  by  the  business,  or  by  IT  personnel  when  troubleshooting  an  application  issue.  It  can  also  save  an  organization  money  if  they  were  using  another,  paid  tool  for  remote  troubleshooting.Facilitates  asynchronous  communication  using  conversation  style.  When  someone  messages  you  a  small  window  pops  up  and  fades  within  a  second  or  two.  You  can  either  click  it  to  open  or  ignore  it  and  open  it  later.  This  is  an  improvement  over ""Jabber s"",  predecessor,  Web  Ex  Connect,  which  would  blink  an  icon  at  the  bottom  of  the  screen  until  you  read  the  message.  This  was  really  annoying  because,  unless  you  could  put  up  with  the  flashing  icon,  you  needed  to  click  on  each  message  right  away.  That  negated  the  concept  of  asynchronous  communications.Facilitates  status  tracking  as  Jabber  has  several  statuses:  green  for  Available,  yellow  for  Away,  red  for  ""Do  not  Disturb"".  Finally  grey  is  for  offline.  It  also  link  with  your  Outlook  and  has  automated  statuses:  ""Presenting"",  i.e.  sharing  your  desktop  with  another  user  via  Jabber  or  Web  Ex  or  ""In  a  meeting"". "," Jabber  could  use  a  middle  ground  for  message  notification.  The  prior  method  of  an  icon  flashing  at  you  every  few  seconds  defeated  the  asynchronous  nature  as  it  would  force  you  to  put  up  with  the  blinking,  or  click  the  message  immediately.  And  if  you  clicked  the  message  just  to  stop  the  blinking,  then  it  would  register  the  message  as  read,  and  it  would  be  easy  to  miss  or  forget  about  the  message  without  actually  reading  it.  Now  they  have  the  popup  window  (described  earlier  in  the  review).  Additionally  when  you  click  on  the  Jabber  app  you  will  see  the  number  of  unread  messages  for  each  user.  If  you  were  on  the  phone  or  speaking  with  a  colleague  you  may  have  missed  the  message  entirely.  Either  way,  its  now  too  easy  to  miss  a  message  and  the  sender  will  use  other  means,  and  ask  why  you  ignored  their  message.  A  good  middle  ground  would  be  features  they  have  now  with  either  a  status  or  something  similar  in  the  system  try  (it  can  even  be  the  flashing  icon,  but  flash  once  every  5  minutes,  not  once  a  second)  which  would  occasionally  remind  you  of  your  unread  instant  messages.Too  many  software  updates.  Jabber  constantly  wants  to  update  the  application  and  if  you  push  it  off  reminds  you  on  every  login.  Bundle  and  space  them  out  further.This  is  minor  but  the  default  installation  comes  with  a  docking  tab  at  the  top  of  the  screen.  If  you  are  not  using  the  tab  then  it  is  annoying.  Virtually  every  user  wants  to  get  rid  of  it  but  they  do  not  know  how.  They  are  always  grateful  to  me  when  I  get  rid  of  it  for  them.Jabber  allows  sending  of  files  but ""it s"",  a  bit  cumbersome  as  it  must  first  be  accepted,  downloaded,  then  opened  from  the  folder.  It  does  give  a  short  cut  to  open  the  download  folder,  but  the  ability  to  directly  open  received  files  would  be  very  helpful.Jabber  does  not  have  an  off-line  queue  as  part  of  its  standard  setup.  Not  a  huge  con,  but  it  add  a  level  of  convenience.  When  someone  is  off-line,  typically  after  they  have  left  for  the  day,  you  either  have  to  wait  to  respond  to  an  IM,  or  move  the  conversation  over  to  email.When  a  new  message  comes  in  the  popup  window,  whether  or  not  you  click  on  it,  when  you  go  to  your  conversations  window,  it  brings  you  back  to  your  last  conversation.  what  happens  is,  you  think  your  in  the  conversation  for  the  window  which  just  popped  up,  and  if  your  lucky  you  catch  your  response  before  sending  to  the  wrong  person.  This  occurs  even  if  you  actually  click  on  the  popup  window,  you  still  may  be  in  a  different  conversation.  I  am  used  to  it  by  now  and  rarely  make  the  mistake,  but  it  would  be  a  really  good  feature  to  bring  you  to  the  conversation  related  to  the  newest  message.

"Jabber - Great Quality, Overkill Features, Pricey Backend"," Jabber  has  been  deployed  for  all  of  our  users  across  the  entire  organization  on  their  desktop/laptop  machines  for  just  over  two  years  now.  Initially,  we  installed  Jabber  because  it  was ""Cisco s"",  upgrade  to  the  old  soft-phones  (PC  phones)  for  their  Call  Manager  (now  Unified  Communications)  system.  Jabber  would  allow  our  users  to  VPN  back  to  our  office  and  use  the  Jabber  client  like  it  was  their  office  phone,  so  their  clients  could  dial  their  office  number  and  reach  them,  dialing  out  would  show  their  office  number  on  caller  ID,  etc.  It  has  other  features  of  course,  but  this  was  our  primary  reason  for  using  Jabber. "," In  general,  call  quality  is  really  good  using  Jabber.  Of  course  it  is  dependent  on  your  network  or  internet  connection  speed  if  used  remotely,  but ""it s"",  much  better  than  many  other  products  we  looked  at  under  the  same  circumstances.  Most  of  the  time  we ""can t"",  tell  when  someone  is  working  remotely  over  the  VPN  using  Jabber.The  user  interface  is  easy  to  use  and  quickly  adopted  by  users.The  search  function  for  contacts  is  quick  and  accurate. "," Federation  (connecting  Jabber  to  other  businesses  to  see  their  availability,  etc.)  is  spotty  and  only  works  under  certain  circumstances.  There  are  different  types  of  federation  using  different  protocols  for  different  types  of  systems  and  we  usually  find  that  no  one  else  knows  what  type  of  system  they  have  and  it  takes  so  much  time  to  troubleshoot  to  setup. ""It s"",  usually  not  worth  it  and  we  give  up.The  presence  indicators  (availability  icons)  only  work  about  60%  of  the  time.  They  read  your  Outlook  calendar  and  also  determine  if ""you re"",  on  the  phone  to  automatically  change  your  availability  icons.  They  are  often  wrong  -  for  most  of  my  users.  You  can  change  it  yourself  manually  too.Using  the  Jabber  app  on  the  i  Phone  requires  the  device  VPN  back  to  your  system.  If  your  UC  system  is  in  the  cloud,  maybe ""that s"",  not  a  big  deal  to  anyone.  All  of  our  equipment  and  systems  are  hosted  in-house,  so  having  our  i  Phones  have  an  open  VPN  back  to  our  network  requires  more  overhead  for  security  and  management  than  we  anticipated. ""We re"",  constantly  testing  to  confirm  everything  is  locked  down  as  much  as  possible  to  avoid  security  issues.  i  Phones  are  not  the  most  secure  devices  and  due  to  the  amount  of  personal  use  on  those  devices,  it  provides  a  prime  target  for  malware  to  gain  access  to  a  network.  Not  many  of  our  users  choose  to  use  Jabber  on  their  i  Phones  anyway,  because  they  have  had  instances  where  the  carrier  connection ""isn t"",  so  good  and  it ""won t"",  hold  a  VPN  stable.

Jabber Review," My  organization  uses  Jabber  across  the  enterprise  and  in  multiple  offices.  The  tool  offers  different  advantages  to  different  people.  For  example,  administrative  assistants  and  associates  use  the  Presence  Management  feature  to  determine  if  certain  people  are  in  the  office.  Associates  use  the  Instant  Messaging/Chat  tool  to  collaborate  with  colleagues  who  are  online.  Associates  and  partners  use  the  Cisco  phone  features  to  stay  connected  when  they  are  out  of  the  office,  providing  seamless  access  to  clients.  I  use  all  the  tools.  I  especially  appreciate  the  phone  connectivity  because  I  can  make  a  call  to  one  of  our  international  offices  without  having  to  dial  international  calling  codes,  etc.  I  simply  use  our  internal  IP  phone  exchanges,  and  I  can  call  another  office  very  easily  especially  when  I  am  at  home. "," Presence  management  is  pretty  accurate.  Jabber  taps  into  Microsoft  Outlook  to  determine  an ""individual s"",  status,  and  it  also  looks  that  the  computer  state.  Our  users  lock  their  computers  when  away  from  their  desk,  and  Jabber  changes  their  status  immediately.The  IP  Phone  capabilities  have  made  us  more  mobile.  Wherever  we  are  connected  using  our  VPN,  the  user  has  his  or  her  phone.The  Presence  Management  feature  has  eliminated  a  lot  of  unnecessary  communication.  Since  a ""user s"",  presence  shows  up  in  Outlook,  I  can  call  or  chat  with  that  individual  instead  of  carrying  on  a  conversation  via  email  or  voicemail.  Communication  has  become  more  timely. "," We  have  had  issues  with  sticky  presence.  We  restart  our  computers  daily,  and  while  the  Jabber  application  shuts  down,  a  user  sometimes  will  still  show  as  available  even  when  his/her  computer  is  no  longer  logged  in.We  went  with  a  different  tool  for  video  conferencing.  The  Jabber  tool  took  up  too  much  bandwidth,  so  we  had  to  go  with  another  vendor. ",19-Oct-15,9 out of 10,Sam Catanzaro,Senior Technology Trainer,Law Practice,1001-5000 employees

Jab for all office Gabs," We  are  using  Jabber  across  the  organization  as  a  whole.  The  main  problem  Jabber  is  addressing  for  us  is  bridging  the  gap  between  staff  that  is  in  the  field  and  staff  that  is  in  office,  as  well  as  just  improving  inner  office  communication.  The  most  beneficial  use  of  Jabber  that  we  have  been  using  is  to  connect  our  survey  crews  that  are  on  client  sites  with  project  managers.  We  are  using  Jabber  across  multiple  devices  using  file  sharing,  video,  voice  and  chat.  It  is  making  a  huge  difference  in  the  efficiency  of  sharing  valuable  site  information  in  real-time.  While  we  are  still  getting  everyone  into  the  habit  of  adopting  this  new  system,  we  know  it  will  be  a  game  changer  for  our  company. "," Connecting  various  devices  -  Jabber  connects  PC,  Mac,  Mobile  and  Tablet  users  where  end  users  can  communicate  seamlessly.Presence  -  having  Jabber  integrated  into  Outlook  has  made  client  and  inner  office  communications  easier  and  provides  more  information  to  fellow  users  when  we  can  see  who  is  in  a  meeting,  away,  or  busy.File  Sharing-  inner  office  file  sharing  we  have  been  doing  through  Jabber  instead  of  email.  It  can  very  quickly  process  and  send  large  files  between  users  without  bogging  down  our  inbox,  this  is  especially  useful  when  collaborating  on  documents.Communication  Escalation-  at  any  time  when  using  Jabber  there  is  an  option  to  take  your  communication  to  the  next  level,  being  able  to  quickly  and  easily  escalate  a  chat  to  a  group  chat,  a  group  chat  to  a  Web  Ex,  sharing  screens-  it  makes  communicating  easy  through  various  mediums. "," The  back  end  of  Jabber  and  creating  the  proper  profiles  in  CUCM  can  be  frustrating.  Often  the  solution  is  easy  e.g.:  ""check  this  box  or  uncheck  this  box""  however  actually  finding  these  areas  in  the  CUCM  profiles  can  be  difficult.  Also,  the  setup  is  not  always  straight  forward,  one  profile  could  have  certain  settings  and  the  next  could  have  completely  different  settings  and  they  both  work.

Webex Meetings is the best way to organize and manage your meetings," Webex  Meetings  is  being  used  by  our  entire  organization.  I  can  easily  say  that ""it s"",  almost  a  default  tool  for  our  daily  communication.  We  use  it  to  communicate  not  only  with  our  colleagues  from  different  regions  within  the  company;  but  also  with  suppliers  or  service  providers  from  outside  the  company.  We  use  it  to  schedule  meetings  and  share  information  during  the  meetings,  and  to  broadcast  information  or  to  review  status.  As  a  summary,  it  is  one  of  the  most  useful  tools  that  have  been  used  so  far  within  our  organization. "," High-resolution  video  conferencing  and  a  variety  of  connectivity  options.  You  can  share  your  screen  or  annotate  other  user  screens  and  make  basic  controls.  You  can  make  video/audio  calls  via  landlines  or  internet  connection  through  your  device.  Audio  quality  is  most  of  the  times  good  and  robust.I  like  Webex  tools  and  add-ons  a  lot,  as  these  really  make  the  office  life  easier  for  me.  The  Outlook  add-on  tool  is  a  very  useful  feature.  You  can  simply  add  the  Web  Ex  link  to  your  invitations  or  launch  instant  or  scheduled  meetings  just  by  one  click  from  Outlook  add-on  button.  Another  good  tool  is  the  Webex  Productivity  tool  which  can  be  added  as  a  shortcut  to  your  desktop.  You  can  manage  all  your  agenda  and  organize  any  meetings  with  this  tool.You  can  also  have  most  of  these  features  on  mobile  versions  of  Webex  as  well. ""I m"",  using  the  i  OS  version  of  the  Webex  app  and  it  gives  me  all  the  flexibility  I  need  while ""I m"",  away  from  my  desk  or  during  business  travels.

These  give  you  the  power  to  have  an  efficient  meeting.You  can  record  meetings  and  trainings  and  save  them  for  use  later  on,  what  a  perfect  feature! "," Voice  quality  depends  on  your  connection  method.  If  you  are  using  a  headset  which  is  connected  to  your  IP  or  landline  phone;  then  the  outcome  is  almost  perfect.  However,  if ""you re"",  using  a  computer  to  dial  in,  the  voice  quality  depends  on  your  internet  speed.Probably  the  only  critical  issue  with  Webex  may  be  the  lag  after  sharing  your  screen  or  after  annotating  (taking  over)  other ""users "",  screen  for  a  long  time  period.The  Webex  interface  is  very  cool  and  simple  but  somehow  the  latest  version  can  cause  users  to  struggle  with  the  controls.Very  rarely,  Webex  servers  can  respond  slowly  or  give  no  response.  I  think  this  is  something  that  can  happen  with  any  service  providers,  so  I ""don t"",  see  it  as  an  issue.

I  can  record  meetings  for  those  that ""can t"",  attend,  or  even  conduct  meetings  away  from  my  desk  through  my  phone  or  tablet.

I  love  the  Exchange  plugin  that  allows  me  to  create  a  meeting  and  add  a  Webex  conference  call  within  the  invite.  Very  easy.  I  had  to  copy  and  paste  from  my  previous  provider.  Not  fun.Starting  a  meeting  is  great,  especially  if ""I m"",  not  the  first  one  on  the  call.

Anyone  can  take  control  of  the  presentation,  or  I  can  lock  it  down  as  needed.

"Not intuitive for all attendees, but with some simplification it has potential"," Webex  is  mostly  used  for  screen-sharing  purposes  for  1  or  more  users  during  a  traditional  conference  call.  The  problem  it  solves  is  by  providing  the  ability  to  share  something  visual  with  another  party,  such  as  walking  someone  through  a  presentation.  This  is  either  dictated  by  my  users  or  by  the  client.  We  have  4  host  accounts  for  users  who  need  to  schedule  their  own  meetings,  but  most  of  the  organization  has  attended  a  Webex  before  as  a  guest.

Amazing collaboration with Webex," Webex  is  being  used  across  my  organisation,  to  support  the  effective  communication  and  collaboration  between  team  members  based  remotely  across  different  countries.  Its  used  in  the  place  of  physical  meetings,  utilising  the  video  conferencing  functions  to  make  colleagues  feel  as  though  they  are  in  the  same  room  together.  Likewise,  collaborative  functions  such  as  enabling  meeting  recordings,  sharing  screens  for  mutual  viewing  and  the  ability  to  work  on  one  document  between  multiple  meeting  attendees  makes  project  management  and  monitoring  straightforward  for  us. "," Webex’s  visual  simplicity  and  ease  of  use  are  key,  as  not  all  colleagues  are  in  technical  roles,  and  encountering  challenges  in  joining  a  call,  sending  a  meeting  request  to  others,  or  sharing  their  content  would  discourage  them  from  using  this  tool  widely  and  thus  keeping  in  close  contact  with  their  remote  team  members.The  call  management  functions  make  it  easy  to  host  professional  presentations  to  large  internal  or  external  audiences,  as  well  as  smaller  team  meetings.  Call  hosts  can  mute  incoming  attendees  to  the  call,  create  a  panel  of  presenters  with  different  access  and  view  rights  to  attendees,  record  the  session,  enable  a  Q&A  panel  for  questions,  and  much  more. "," The  integration  with  the  Webex  Teams  app  occasionally  causes  confusion  when  joining  or  starting  a  meeting,  as  the  meeting  can  sometimes  automatically  launch  through  Webex  Teams,  as  well  as  through  Webex  itself  online  or  on  desktop.  This  can  lead  to  time  lost  at  the  start  of  a  meeting,  trying  to  figure  out  which  to  use  and  what’s  going  on.  It  would  be  better  to  limit  the  meeting  exclusively  to  one  or  the  other.An  advantage  of  using  Webex  is  that  colleagues  can  work  from  anywhere-  their  home  office  or  a  public  space.  Their  video  can  be  distracting  in  these  cases,  however,  drawing  attention  away  from  the  meeting.  It  would  therefore  be  beneficial  to  have  the  ability  to  set  a  background  scene  or  image  behind  the  user,  using  facial  recognition  technology.

"Webex - Nothing More (than its peers), Nothing Less (unless you skimped on your license)"," Webex  is  being  used  in  our  organization  primarily  for  online  meetings  that  involve  screen  share.  It  is  currently  being  phased  out  in  our  company  in  favor  of  Microsoft  Teams  Meeting.  Because  of  our  licensing  agreement  with  Webex,  only  a  portion  of  the  users  were  able  to  use  integrated  audio  as  well.  Most  users  only  have  access  to  the  screen  sharing  portion  and  telephony  was  handled  by  a  separate  conference  bridge. ", Webex  was  easily  accessible  throughout  the  org  for  meetings  -  the  integration  with  Outlook  was  pretty  good.Webex  did  a  good  job  with  screen  sharing  and  the  standard  webconference  (non-audio)  features.The  Webex  app  was  not  insignificant.  I  used  it  on  an  iphone  as  a  supplement  and  it  was  very  useful. ," Not  inherently  connecting  VOIP  with  the  screen  sharing  meant  (for  us)  that  we  always  had  to  wrangle  2  tools  to  start  a  meeting  rather  than  1.The  Webex  desktop  app  was  helpful,  like  the  mobile  app,  but  the  primary  experience  our  company  was  likely  sold  against  was  the  web  version.  That  is  the  weaker  of  the  3  platforms.Webex  recordings  were  very  difficult  to  make,  edit,  download  and  convert.  Simplicity  would  have  served  them  well.Attaching  a  dial  in  conference  bridge  (again,  because  of  our  licensing  model)  was  a  below  average  experience.

Webex Meetings is a great platform for remote collaborations and presentations," At  my  current  company,  Webex  Meetings  is  currently  used  for  large  meetings  that  need  to  include  employees  not  onsite,  sharing  content  with  external  collaborators,  or  sometimes  internally  to  screen  share.

Personally,  it  has  helped  to  include  employees  that  work  offsite  or  at  home  that  need  to  attend  group  meetings. "," Web  Ex  Meetings  enables  large  and  small  audience  meetings.  It  is  very  scalable.  It  can  be  an  interactive  meeting  with  3-5  attendees  or  a  webinar  with  over  100.The  host  can  configure  a  ton  of  options  for  the  meeting  so  that  it  can  run  smoothly.  i.e.  mute  all  attendees,  allow/disable  screen  sharing,  or  grant  access  to  specific  features  to  attendees.The  integration  with  Microsoft  Office,  especially  Outlook,  is  very  useful.  If  the  tools  are  installed,  a  Webex  meeting  can  be  created  and  added  to  a  scheduled  meeting  easily  at  the  same  time  as  scheduling  the  meeting.

"Traditional, Safe Choice, but Not Intuitive"," My  organization  used  Web  Ex  Meetings  for  much  of  our  video  and  audio  conferencing  needs,  both  within  the  organization  and  with  external  clients.  As  we  are  located  on  both  sides  of  the  country  and  our  clients  were  dispersed  across  the  US  and  overseas,  this  allowed  us  to  communicate  with  each  other  relatively  easily. "," The  calendar  on  the  platform  provides  a  good  visual  as  to  when  meetings  are  scheduled.  It  helps  when  we  are  scheduling  new  meetings  to  be  able  to  easily  see  when  meetings  are  already  scheduled  to  start  and  end,  so  we  can  avoid  double-booking.There  are  many  features  within  the  application,  including  the  ability  to  share  and  upload  files  to  present,  a  feature  we  used  often.

"," Sometimes  the  video  quality  goes  way  down  and  we  can  barely  see  the  faces  of  the  people  on  the  other  end.  This  may  have  to  do  with  the  internet  connectivity,  as  the  other  party  is  our  team  in  a  different  location,  and  we  know  they  use  the  same  (high  quality)  camera  all  the  time,  so ""it s"",  not  due  to  the  camera.We  upload  files  to  share  during  the  meetings,  and  it ""won t"",  take  certain  files.

Enabling Global Teams with WebEx, Currently  we  are  using  Web  Ex  Meetings  as  our  primary  tool  for  meetings  and  conferencing  both  internally  and  with  external  vendors  and  customers.  Prior  to  our  company  wide  Web  Ex  deployment  last  year  we  had  a  variety  of  tools  in  our  environment  for  phone  conferencing  and  remote  meetings.  Consolidating  down  to  one  solution  allowed  us  to  provide  a  very  stable  consistent  experience  around  the  globe  as  well  as  enabling  some  significant  cost  savings. ," Web  Ex  provides  attendees  with  several  options  for  connecting  to  meeting  audio  including  computer  headsets,  800  and  local  numbers  as  well  as  a  call  me  feature.  This  makes  it  easy  for  people  to  connect  no  matter  where  they  are  or  what  device  they  are  using  to  connect.In  our  experience  the  audio  and  video  streams  during  our  meetings  have  been  very  stable  and  smooth.  This  enables  very  effective  meetings  without  audio  or  video  interruptions  getting  in  the  way.Web  Ex  has  many  useful  features  that  enable  a  very  strong  meeting  experience.  Audio/Video,  Screen  Sharing  and  Whiteboard  just  to  name  a  few. ", During  our  initial  deployment  we  had  difficulty  installing  the  client  on  systems  which  already  had  a  previous  version  of  Web  Ex  installed.  There  was  no  Web  Ex  cleanup  utility  that  worked  properly  which  forced  us  to  write  our  own  to  clean  previous  versions  off  of  systems  prior  to  installing  a  new  client.The  Web  Ex  client  and  server  tends  to  update  very  frequently  which  introduced  difficulty  during  our  initial  deployment.  This  was  especially  true  with  our  associates  who  do  not  have  admin  rights  on  their  PC.Technical  support  during  the  packaging  and  deployment  stage  of  our  implementation  could  have  been  a  bit  better.  We  ended  up  creating  our  own  solutions  and  resolving  issues  frequently  where  Web  Ex  was  not  able  to. ,17-Jun-16,8 out of 10,Verified User,Administrator in Information Technology,Chemicals Company,"10,001+ employees"

Communication with Freedom of Location, We  are  in  the  process  of  rolling  out  Cisco  Jabber  to  our  enterprise  community.  We  have  been  piloting  it  for  quite  some  time  now  and  it  is  one  of  my  favorite  collaboration  tools  that  we  have  attempted  to  use  in  our  organization.  We  plan  to  provide  this  to  users  in  our  organization  that  currently  have  or  request  a  phone  line  for  business  purposes.  Our  users  will  have  the  flexibility  of  using  that  phone  line  on  either  a  Cisco  Jabber  client  or  on  the  client  and  a  physical  desk  phone.  The  problem  that  Cisco  Jabber  addresses  for  us  is  that  it  provides  the  ability  for  our  user  community  to  be  mobile  and  flexible  in  location  of  where  they  do  their  work  while  still  remaining  reachable  for  collaboration  with  others.  To  this  point  our  user  community  that  has  already  been  given  access  to  the  platform  is  very  satisfied  with  the  capability  to  communicate  with  the  tool.  Many  users  have  commented  to  us  that  they  wish  we  had  provided  this  capability  quite  some  time  ago.  Many  users  were  aware  that  the  product  existed  based  on  past  experience  with  another  employer  or  just  as  a  matter  of  having  researched  the  available  tools  for  collaboration  that  are  currently  popular. , The  Cisco  Jabber  client  allows  a  user  the  flexibility  of  location  while  still  being  available  to  anyone  for  collaboration  and  communication.  No  longer  tethered  to  a  desk  to  take  calls.  This  is  a  huge  benefit  in  my  mind  Cisco  Jabber  also  provides  presence  and  availability  status  without  even  needing  to  actually  call  or  send  a  message  to  someone  to  determine  availability.  This  saves  a  ton  of  time  from  wasted  effort  trying  to  find  someone  and  learn  if  they  are  available  to  collaborate.When  configured  correctly  Cisco  Jabber  can  also  be  integrated  with  some  calendaring  systems  to  automatically  update  the  status  of  a  user. , There  is  some  brand  confusion  that  exists  between  Cisco  communication  products.  This  is  more  relevant  to  the  support  personnel  and  engineers  that  would  be  making  decisions  to  implement  the  product.  Cisco  has  their  Spark/Web  Ex  platform  that  provides  collaboration/communication  functionality  and  more  to  the  end  users.  Cisco  has  stated  at  some  conferences  that  I  attended  that  they  are  committed  to  maintaining  and  developing  the  Cisco  Jabber  platform  still  so  that  is  very  promising  since  the  product  serves  different  needs.Cisco  Jabber  is  a  little  complex  to  implement  properly  in  your  environment.  The  larger  the  communication  cluster  the  more  complicated  it  can  become.  There  are  also  some  additional  features  like  persistent  chat  that  require  extra  resources  like  a  standalone  database  for  persistent  chat. ,9-Aug-18,9 out of 10,Eric Taylor,VoIP Network Administrator,Higher Education,"10,001+ employees"
Great platform for interoffice communication," Jabber  is  available  and  used  by  almost  everyone  in  our  organization.  It  is  used  to  communicate  between  staff  and  attorneys,  as  well  as  among  attorneys.  It  relieves  us  from  excessive  emails  and  allows  us  to  quickly  chat  on  work,  personal  and  other  matters  in  an  efficient  manner.

Jabber at the Office," Jabber  is  used  across  the  organization.  It  is  pretty  much  an  internal  communication  system  that  is  linked  to  the  telephone  system.  We  can  use  it  to  send  direct  and  instant  messages  (similar  to  a  chat  service),  make  phone  calls,  receive  calls,  send  and  receive  messages.

Great replacement for desk phones," We  use  Jabber  across  the  enterprise.  In  order  to  reduce  hardware  and  licensing  costs,  we  needed  a  solution  that  replaced  our  existing  use  of  Skype  for  Business;  integrated  into  a  Cisco  Vo  IP  solution,  allowed  remote  users  to  be  issued  a  direct  number,  and  provided  simple,  straightforward  instant  messaging.  From  our  cost-benefit  analyses,  Jabber  was  significantly  cheaper  than  similar  solutions  from  Skype  for  Business  or  Citrix,  and  because  of  its  integration  into  the  Cisco  UCS  environment,  it  was  easy  to  deploy  out  the  enterprise. "," Provides  unified,  simple  to  use  instant  messaging  across  departments,  groups,  and  projects.Makes  it  easy  for  users  to  move  from  their  mobile  phones  to  the  desktop  to  a  physical  phone.Presence  indicators  pull  nicely  from  Outlook  so  users ""don t"",  have  to  mark  themselves  as  being  in  a  meeting  or  otherwise  unavailable.

Jabbering Away on Cisco Jabber," Jabber  is  currently  being  used  by  my  whole  organization  as  an  internal  instant  messaging  tool.  It  is  helpful  because  it  is  tied  to  our  phone  services  and  we  can  see  when  someone  is  in  a  meeting  or  not  without  opening  up  Outlook.  It  also  cuts  down  on  the  amount  of  emails  we  send  since  we  can  have  real-time  conversations  about  an  issue  or  use  it  to  answer  quick  questions  that ""don t"",  really  need  an  email.  It  makes  communication  easier  and  more  efficient. ", It  integrates  phone  services  so  that  you  can  see  who  is  calling  and  even  dial  using  your  computer.

Jabber up a storm., Jabber  was  implemented  once  the  product  became  a  more  mature  solution  to  our  collaboration  needs.

Using Jabber to Blabber with your coworkers at a large non-profit," Our  entire  organization  of  approximately  500-600  employees  uses  jabber  very  often  on  a  daily  basis  as  our  primary  means  of  instant  communication.  Besides  e-mail,  we  use  jabber  in  our  organization  to  ask  urgent  questions,  notify  others  of  things  quickly  or  send  more  informal  messages  that  don’t  require  a  full  email  or  phone  call.  It  allows  us  to  communicate  much  more  effectively  because  our  employees  are  usually  busy  and  not  confined  to  their  office  or  desk,  so  if  they  miss  a  phone  call  it  becomes  very  easy  to  play  phone  tag  all  day.  Jabber  is  also  a  more  casual  form  of  sending  messages  you  may  not  want  to  send  in  an  e-mail,  and  allows  you  to  use  emojis  and  attachments  to  illustrate  your  point.

Dependable IP Telephone Access From Your Computer, My  company  utilizes  Jabber  throughout  the  entire  organization.  It  gives  us  a  mechanism  for  communication  throughout  our  organization  both  via  voice  and  video  calls  and  by  way  of  instant  messaging. ," My  favorite  use  of  Jabber  is  for  making  and  receiving  phone  calls  from  my  PC.  For  outgoing  calls  I  can  search  through  the  corporate  database  of  employees  to  select  my  recipient  and  call  right  from  my  computer.  All  incoming  calls  ring  both  on  my  desk  phone  and  on  my  PC,  allowing  me  to  receive  a  call  using  my  headset  and  microphone  even  when ""I m"",  working  remotely.Jabber  provides  a  unified  platform  for  sending  instant  messages  to  any  employee  within  our  organization.Jabber  displays  the  availability  of  each  employee.  The  fact  that  it  syncs  up  with  our  company  calendars  makes  this  feature  useful  for  determining  if  an  employee  is  currently  in  a  meeting.

This  could  of  course  be  attributed  to  our ""company s"",  network  infrastructure  but ""I ve"",  not  had  many  connectivity  problems  otherwise.Some  versions  of  Jabber  display  ""toast""  messages  every  time  a  user  comes  online.  This  is  rather  annoying  and  although  they  provided  a  mechanism  for  silencing  these  toasts,  its  on  a  per-user  basis  and  it  is  not  intuitively  obvious  how  to  silence  them.

Jabber for efficient communication," Jabber  is  used  by  most  of  our  company. ""It s"",  great  for  a  variety  of  reasons.  Our  offices  are  located  all  over  the  country,  so  if  you  have  a  quick  question  and ""don t"",  want  it  to  get  buried  under  emails,  you  can  just  jabber  someone  in  New  York  or  Michigan  and ""they ll"",  reply  quickly.

Jabber keeps you connected when you move throughout the day," As  far  as  I  know,  it  is  being  used  across  the  whole  organization.  Anyone  who  is  logged  into  a  computer  and  has  an  extension  is  able  to  use  it.  I  think  it  gives  more  means  of  communication  to  help  connect  the  campuses.  This  is  a  community  college  that  has  several  campuses  spread  out  across  central  PA,  so  having  varying  forms  of  communication  across  these  is  important.  It  also  helps  with  staff/faculty  who  move  offices  and  are  not  always  at  a  phone  with  their  extension.  They  are  able  to  use  Jabber  to  check  voicemail,  for  example. "," Jabber  adds  a  good  chat  element  of  communication,  which  is  not  available  with  other  technology  or  software  that ""I ve"",  seen  here  on  campus.  This  is  nice  for  quick  questions  with  someone  that  you ""don t"",  want  to  bother  with  a  phone  call,  but  are  hoping  for  a  quick  response  (faster  than  email).Another  perk  is  the  ability  to  see  if  you  are  receiving  a  phone  call.  If  you  have  a  microphone  and  headphones  set  up,  you  can  even  answer  it  from  your  computer,  you ""don t"",  have  to  be  right  by  your  phone  at  all  times.And  my  favorite  is  that  you  can  see  your  voicemail  from  Jabber.  You  can  see  if  you  have  one  and  also  listen  to  it  if  you  have  speakers/headphones.  This  way  you ""don t"",  have  to  wait  to  get  to  your  phone  the  next  day  to  hear  any  voicemail  you  may  get  when  you  are  at  another  location  away  from  your  main  phone. "," I  think  it  could  be  clearer  how  to  log  out  of  it.  I  can  click  on  it  to  get  in,  but  then  it  just  stays  open,  even  if  I  close  the  box.  There  is  a  pop  out  from  the  top  of  my  screen  that  stays.  I  think  a  clearer  log-off  button  on  the  box  would  be  helpful.Is  there  a  mobile  application  for  this?

They  make  you  update  the  software  by  not  allowing  you  to  skip.My  Jabber  was  not  able  to  connect  me  directly  to  the  conference  call.  I  had  to  join  in  using  the  actual  phone.  This  could  be  a  problem  just  for  my  company  though.Group  messaging  was  hard.  Every  time  I  had  to  add  the  participants.

IM Disappointed," Jabber  is  being  used  across  the  entire  organization  for  IM,  presence,  click-to-call,  click-to-email,  and  voicemail.  It  addresses  the  need  to  communicate  with  others  in  a  different  part  of  the  building,  country,  or  world.  It  is  important  to  know  whether  or  not  a  person  is  available  based  on  their  presence.  If  they  are  offline,  or  in  a  meeting,  or  not  at  their  desk,  Jabber  will  tell  you  their  presence.  It  can  also  be  used  as  an  alternative  to  the  desk  phone  for  checking  voicemails,  which  is  convenient  if  someone  is  not  at  their  desk. "," Instant  Messaging  Presence  Contact  details  (phone,  email,  etc.) "," Does  not  keep  track  of  conversation  history. ""Can t"",  see  what  I  said  yesterday  to  a  person.  This  is  really  important,  since  people  communicate  important  info  to  one  another,  and  that  can  just  disappear,  requiring  another  round  of  communication.  Would  be  better  to  just  scroll  up  in  history  like ""competitors "",  tools  do.No  chat  rooms,  must  manually  add  members  to  group  chat  each  time.  No  notion  of  teams/named  groups,  only  individuals.Does  not  automatically  log  in  to  Web  Ex,  prompts  for  a  log  in  each  time.Difficult  to  set  a  profile  picture,  so  people  see  a  gray  outline  instead  of  my  face.  I  think  this  is  coming  from  my  pic  in  Active  Directory,  but  I  should  be  able  to  customize  it  like  with  other  apps.Overall  lack  of  features.  It  comes  from  Cisco,  so  all  the  integrations  have  to  do  with  phones  and  voicemail.  I ""don t"",  have  a  need  for  this  in  my  IM  client,  since  I  do  not  use  my  work  phone  at  all.  So  it  does  a  really  poor  job  at  the  only  thing  I  use  it  for.  I  have  stopped  using  it  recently,  since  everyone  I  need  to  talk  to  frequently  is  on  Hip  Chat,  which  my  company  also  uses.  This  is  bad,  since  all  the  people  who  use  Jabber  and  not  Hip  Chat  see  me  as  offline  even  though  I  am  available.Jabber  is  very  cumbersome  to  use,  since  I  only  use  it  for  IM,  and ""it s"",  missing  many  features  that  a  client  that  focused  specifically  on  IM  would  provide,  such  as  group  chat,  chat  rooms,  and  message  history.Cannot  send  attachments  to  offline  recipients.Very  limited  ability  for  rich  content:  Cannot  display  images  in  IM  text,  cannot  use  emojis/stickers  or  add  custom  emoticons.

Why just chat when you can Jabber!," Jabber  is  a  huge  collaboration  tool  in  our  environment.  It  is  not  just  a  simple  chat  window  for  us  to  remotely  chat,  but  it  is  also  a  great  tool  to  show  availability.  We  also  use  the  share  desktop  feature  a  lot  to  collaborate  and  troubleshoot.

Recent  chats,  meetings,  and  contacts  are  easy  to  find  and  easy  to  modify.  I  love  how  the  meetings  have  a  link  into  the  Web  Ex  part  so  you ""don t"",  even  have  to  go  into  Outlook  to  reach  it.The  Mobile  app  is  a  great  way  to  reach  someone  after  hours  for  emergencies.

Jabber- Great for Messaging and Desktop Sharing," Jabber  is  being  used  as  our ""company s"",  instant  messaging  tool,  connecting  team,  departments,  and  the  entire  organization  in  a  useful  alternative  to  email.  Like  email  it  provides  an  asynchronous  means  of  sending  and  receiving  messages  in  a  less  disruptive  manner  than  phone,  or  face  to  face  conversations.  Additionally  with  the  availability  status  it  is  easy  to  know  if  a  coworker  is  in  the  office.  Finally,  Jabber  has  an  excellent  feature  that  allows  you  to  share  your  desktop  with  another  user,  and  even  grant  control.  This  facilitates  collaboration  and  even  IT  help  desk  support  as  you  can  view  users  desks  remotely. "," Jabber  is  excellent  for  remote  troubleshooting  as  it  allows  remote  desktop  sharing  and  even  control.  It  is  very  easy  to  setup  a  sharing  session-  literally  seconds-  even  for  non  technical  users.  This  can  be  used  by  the  business,  or  by  IT  personnel  when  troubleshooting  an  application  issue.  It  can  also  save  an  organization  money  if  they  were  using  another,  paid  tool  for  remote  troubleshooting.Facilitates  asynchronous  communication  using  conversation  style.  When  someone  messages  you  a  small  window  pops  up  and  fades  within  a  second  or  two.  You  can  either  click  it  to  open  or  ignore  it  and  open  it  later.  This  is  an  improvement  over ""Jabber s"",  predecessor,  Web  Ex  Connect,  which  would  blink  an  icon  at  the  bottom  of  the  screen  until  you  read  the  message.  This  was  really  annoying  because,  unless  you  could  put  up  with  the  flashing  icon,  you  needed  to  click  on  each  message  right  away.  That  negated  the  concept  of  asynchronous  communications.Facilitates  status  tracking  as  Jabber  has  several  statuses:  green  for  Available,  yellow  for  Away,  red  for  ""Do  not  Disturb"".  Finally  grey  is  for  offline.  It  also  link  with  your  Outlook  and  has  automated  statuses:  ""Presenting"",  i.e.  sharing  your  desktop  with  another  user  via  Jabber  or  Web  Ex  or  ""In  a  meeting"". "," Jabber  could  use  a  middle  ground  for  message  notification.  The  prior  method  of  an  icon  flashing  at  you  every  few  seconds  defeated  the  asynchronous  nature  as  it  would  force  you  to  put  up  with  the  blinking,  or  click  the  message  immediately.  And  if  you  clicked  the  message  just  to  stop  the  blinking,  then  it  would  register  the  message  as  read,  and  it  would  be  easy  to  miss  or  forget  about  the  message  without  actually  reading  it.  Now  they  have  the  popup  window  (described  earlier  in  the  review).  Additionally  when  you  click  on  the  Jabber  app  you  will  see  the  number  of  unread  messages  for  each  user.  If  you  were  on  the  phone  or  speaking  with  a  colleague  you  may  have  missed  the  message  entirely.  Either  way,  its  now  too  easy  to  miss  a  message  and  the  sender  will  use  other  means,  and  ask  why  you  ignored  their  message.  A  good  middle  ground  would  be  features  they  have  now  with  either  a  status  or  something  similar  in  the  system  try  (it  can  even  be  the  flashing  icon,  but  flash  once  every  5  minutes,  not  once  a  second)  which  would  occasionally  remind  you  of  your  unread  instant  messages.Too  many  software  updates.  Jabber  constantly  wants  to  update  the  application  and  if  you  push  it  off  reminds  you  on  every  login.  Bundle  and  space  them  out  further.This  is  minor  but  the  default  installation  comes  with  a  docking  tab  at  the  top  of  the  screen.  If  you  are  not  using  the  tab  then  it  is  annoying.  Virtually  every  user  wants  to  get  rid  of  it  but  they  do  not  know  how.  They  are  always  grateful  to  me  when  I  get  rid  of  it  for  them.Jabber  allows  sending  of  files  but ""it s"",  a  bit  cumbersome  as  it  must  first  be  accepted,  downloaded,  then  opened  from  the  folder.  It  does  give  a  short  cut  to  open  the  download  folder,  but  the  ability  to  directly  open  received  files  would  be  very  helpful.Jabber  does  not  have  an  off-line  queue  as  part  of  its  standard  setup.  Not  a  huge  con,  but  it  add  a  level  of  convenience.  When  someone  is  off-line,  typically  after  they  have  left  for  the  day,  you  either  have  to  wait  to  respond  to  an  IM,  or  move  the  conversation  over  to  email.When  a  new  message  comes  in  the  popup  window,  whether  or  not  you  click  on  it,  when  you  go  to  your  conversations  window,  it  brings  you  back  to  your  last  conversation.  what  happens  is,  you  think  your  in  the  conversation  for  the  window  which  just  popped  up,  and  if  your  lucky  you  catch  your  response  before  sending  to  the  wrong  person.  This  occurs  even  if  you  actually  click  on  the  popup  window,  you  still  may  be  in  a  different  conversation.  I  am  used  to  it  by  now  and  rarely  make  the  mistake,  but  it  would  be  a  really  good  feature  to  bring  you  to  the  conversation  related  to  the  newest  message.

"Jabber - Great Quality, Overkill Features, Pricey Backend"," Jabber  has  been  deployed  for  all  of  our  users  across  the  entire  organization  on  their  desktop/laptop  machines  for  just  over  two  years  now.  Initially,  we  installed  Jabber  because  it  was ""Cisco s"",  upgrade  to  the  old  soft-phones  (PC  phones)  for  their  Call  Manager  (now  Unified  Communications)  system.  Jabber  would  allow  our  users  to  VPN  back  to  our  office  and  use  the  Jabber  client  like  it  was  their  office  phone,  so  their  clients  could  dial  their  office  number  and  reach  them,  dialing  out  would  show  their  office  number  on  caller  ID,  etc.  It  has  other  features  of  course,  but  this  was  our  primary  reason  for  using  Jabber. "," In  general,  call  quality  is  really  good  using  Jabber.  Of  course  it  is  dependent  on  your  network  or  internet  connection  speed  if  used  remotely,  but ""it s"",  much  better  than  many  other  products  we  looked  at  under  the  same  circumstances.  Most  of  the  time  we ""can t"",  tell  when  someone  is  working  remotely  over  the  VPN  using  Jabber.The  user  interface  is  easy  to  use  and  quickly  adopted  by  users.The  search  function  for  contacts  is  quick  and  accurate. "," Federation  (connecting  Jabber  to  other  businesses  to  see  their  availability,  etc.)  is  spotty  and  only  works  under  certain  circumstances.  There  are  different  types  of  federation  using  different  protocols  for  different  types  of  systems  and  we  usually  find  that  no  one  else  knows  what  type  of  system  they  have  and  it  takes  so  much  time  to  troubleshoot  to  setup. ""It s"",  usually  not  worth  it  and  we  give  up.The  presence  indicators  (availability  icons)  only  work  about  60%  of  the  time.  They  read  your  Outlook  calendar  and  also  determine  if ""you re"",  on  the  phone  to  automatically  change  your  availability  icons.  They  are  often  wrong  -  for  most  of  my  users.  You  can  change  it  yourself  manually  too.Using  the  Jabber  app  on  the  i  Phone  requires  the  device  VPN  back  to  your  system.  If  your  UC  system  is  in  the  cloud,  maybe ""that s"",  not  a  big  deal  to  anyone.  All  of  our  equipment  and  systems  are  hosted  in-house,  so  having  our  i  Phones  have  an  open  VPN  back  to  our  network  requires  more  overhead  for  security  and  management  than  we  anticipated. ""We re"",  constantly  testing  to  confirm  everything  is  locked  down  as  much  as  possible  to  avoid  security  issues.  i  Phones  are  not  the  most  secure  devices  and  due  to  the  amount  of  personal  use  on  those  devices,  it  provides  a  prime  target  for  malware  to  gain  access  to  a  network.  Not  many  of  our  users  choose  to  use  Jabber  on  their  i  Phones  anyway,  because  they  have  had  instances  where  the  carrier  connection ""isn t"",  so  good  and  it ""won t"",  hold  a  VPN  stable.

Jabber Review," My  organization  uses  Jabber  across  the  enterprise  and  in  multiple  offices.  The  tool  offers  different  advantages  to  different  people.  For  example,  administrative  assistants  and  associates  use  the  Presence  Management  feature  to  determine  if  certain  people  are  in  the  office.  Associates  use  the  Instant  Messaging/Chat  tool  to  collaborate  with  colleagues  who  are  online.  Associates  and  partners  use  the  Cisco  phone  features  to  stay  connected  when  they  are  out  of  the  office,  providing  seamless  access  to  clients.  I  use  all  the  tools.  I  especially  appreciate  the  phone  connectivity  because  I  can  make  a  call  to  one  of  our  international  offices  without  having  to  dial  international  calling  codes,  etc.  I  simply  use  our  internal  IP  phone  exchanges,  and  I  can  call  another  office  very  easily  especially  when  I  am  at  home. "," Presence  management  is  pretty  accurate.  Jabber  taps  into  Microsoft  Outlook  to  determine  an ""individual s"",  status,  and  it  also  looks  that  the  computer  state.  Our  users  lock  their  computers  when  away  from  their  desk,  and  Jabber  changes  their  status  immediately.The  IP  Phone  capabilities  have  made  us  more  mobile.  Wherever  we  are  connected  using  our  VPN,  the  user  has  his  or  her  phone.The  Presence  Management  feature  has  eliminated  a  lot  of  unnecessary  communication.  Since  a ""user s"",  presence  shows  up  in  Outlook,  I  can  call  or  chat  with  that  individual  instead  of  carrying  on  a  conversation  via  email  or  voicemail.  Communication  has  become  more  timely. "," We  have  had  issues  with  sticky  presence.  We  restart  our  computers  daily,  and  while  the  Jabber  application  shuts  down,  a  user  sometimes  will  still  show  as  available  even  when  his/her  computer  is  no  longer  logged  in.We  went  with  a  different  tool  for  video  conferencing.  The  Jabber  tool  took  up  too  much  bandwidth,  so  we  had  to  go  with  another  vendor. ",19-Oct-15,9 out of 10,Sam Catanzaro,Senior Technology Trainer,Law Practice,1001-5000 employees

Jab for all office Gabs," We  are  using  Jabber  across  the  organization  as  a  whole.  The  main  problem  Jabber  is  addressing  for  us  is  bridging  the  gap  between  staff  that  is  in  the  field  and  staff  that  is  in  office,  as  well  as  just  improving  inner  office  communication.  The  most  beneficial  use  of  Jabber  that  we  have  been  using  is  to  connect  our  survey  crews  that  are  on  client  sites  with  project  managers.  We  are  using  Jabber  across  multiple  devices  using  file  sharing,  video,  voice  and  chat.  It  is  making  a  huge  difference  in  the  efficiency  of  sharing  valuable  site  information  in  real-time.  While  we  are  still  getting  everyone  into  the  habit  of  adopting  this  new  system,  we  know  it  will  be  a  game  changer  for  our  company. "," Connecting  various  devices  -  Jabber  connects  PC,  Mac,  Mobile  and  Tablet  users  where  end  users  can  communicate  seamlessly.Presence  -  having  Jabber  integrated  into  Outlook  has  made  client  and  inner  office  communications  easier  and  provides  more  information  to  fellow  users  when  we  can  see  who  is  in  a  meeting,  away,  or  busy.File  Sharing-  inner  office  file  sharing  we  have  been  doing  through  Jabber  instead  of  email.  It  can  very  quickly  process  and  send  large  files  between  users  without  bogging  down  our  inbox,  this  is  especially  useful  when  collaborating  on  documents.Communication  Escalation-  at  any  time  when  using  Jabber  there  is  an  option  to  take  your  communication  to  the  next  level,  being  able  to  quickly  and  easily  escalate  a  chat  to  a  group  chat,  a  group  chat  to  a  Web  Ex,  sharing  screens-  it  makes  communicating  easy  through  various  mediums. "," The  back  end  of  Jabber  and  creating  the  proper  profiles  in  CUCM  can  be  frustrating.  Often  the  solution  is  easy  e.g.:  ""check  this  box  or  uncheck  this  box""  however  actually  finding  these  areas  in  the  CUCM  profiles  can  be  difficult.  Also,  the  setup  is  not  always  straight  forward,  one  profile  could  have  certain  settings  and  the  next  could  have  completely  different  settings  and  they  both  work.

Excellent Unified Platform for Large Organizations," Cisco  Jabber  is  being  used  across  our  entire  organization,  after  a  recent  amalgamation  of  multiple  systems.  We  use  it  on  a  daily  basis  to  communicate  with  project  teams  in  multiple  offices  across  the  country.  Jabber  has  enabled  faster  communication,  both  peer-to-peer  and  peer-to-group,  throughout  the  many  teams  at  our  company.  One  challenge  Jabber  has  helped  us  address  is  the  need  for  instant  communication  between  offices  across  the  country.

When  someone  sends  an  image  in  a  message,  and  then  you  try  and  copy-paste  it  into  another  chat,  it  appears  as  a  file  transfer  instead  of  just  sending  the  image  in  the  chat.

A Review of Cisco Jabber," We  utilized  Jabber  across  our  entire  organization  with  my  past  employer.  Jabber  served  as  an  efficient  platform  for  establishing  messages  as  well  as  connecting  seamlessly  to  all  of  our  work  schedules,  cell  phones,  and  e-calendars.  It  was  useful  for  identifying  if  co-workers  were  at  work  that  particular  day  or  in  a  meeting  or  maybe  even  just  away  from  their  computer  for  a  bit. "," If  individuals  work  for  your  company,  their  name  and  title  is  shown,  as  well  as  recent  transactions ""you ve"",  had  with  them.  In  a  dynamic  environment  such  as  the  one  I  was  employed,  it  was  very  organized  and  beneficial.A  strength  of  Jabber  would  be  the  integration  involving  alternate  services  a  business  might  provide.  It  lets  coworkers  know  if  you  are  presenting  a  Power  Point  slide  show  by  flashing  ""In  Presentation  Mode""  which  lets  colleagues  know  not  to  message  you  at  that  time.Everything  works  pretty  smoothly  and  without  a  hitch.  Another  strength  of  Jabber  is  that ""it s"",  been  around  long  to  enough  to  have  many  of  the  bugs  and  kinks  worked  out. ","""I d"",  kind  of  like  to  see  Jabber  become  fully  cloud-based.  When  I  utilized  the  program,  it  was  mainly  a  separate  item  on  our  system.  While  this ""wasn t"",  necessarily  a  setback,  it  mainly  had  an  overall  aesthetic  of  a  more  dated  technology.The  Jabber  app ""doesn t"",  store  credentials  for  logging  in  when  I  sign  on.  Basically  every  time  I  would  re-open  the  app  I  would  have  to  re-type  my  log-in  info.  It  made  me  a  little  more  hesitant  to  use  the  app  on  the  road.I  would  also  have  liked  to  see  file  transfer  somehow  be  sped-up.  Transferring  of  files  is  pretty  simple  to  locate  on  Jabber,  but  the  wait  time  is  a  bit  of  a  drag  and  sometimes  it  even  fails.  Some  improvement  could  be  made  in  this  regard. ",24-Jul-18,9 out of 10,Verified User,Manager in Quality Assurance,Civil Engineering Company,51-200 employees

"Know your limits with Webex Teams, and it will treat you well"," We  are  using  Webex  Teams  to  host  distributed  meetings  for  staff  and  to  hold  distance  learning  classes  at  our  university.

There  are  also  multiple  ways  to  integrate  with  legacy  systems  during  a  system  migration  or  when  integrating  a  new  company  or  office. , Licensing  can  be  difficult  to  understand.  Cisco  has  changed  licensing  models  multiple  times  over  the  years  and  determining  what  modes  is  best  suited  for  your  company  can  be  difficult.Systems  backups  need  some  work.  If  you  are  in  a  multi  server  geographically  separated  environment  backups  can  be  a  problem.  All  servers  are  included  in  a  backup  session  and  if  servers  are  across  a  WAN  connection  all  that  data  is  being  pulled  across  the  WAN.  I  would  like  to  see  cloud  backup  or  multi  location  backup  options.When  phones  move  between  sites/subnets  it  would  be  nice  to  have  a  feature  that  could  automatically  move  the  phone  configuration  from  one  device  pool  to  another  so  that  location  specific  options  are  set  for  the  moved  phone. ,2-Oct-19,10 out of 10,Brian Munn,Network Services Manager,Construction,1001-5000 employees

Cisco IP Phone," Cisco  is  used  throughout  the  entire  organization.  I  believe  it  was  about  5  years  (maybe  more)  when  they  changed  to  Cisco  and  we  got  new  phones. ""It s"",  nice  to  be  able  to  log  into  your  voicemail  (or  even  your  extension)  from  a  different  phone  if  you  need  to  move.  I  also  like  how ""it s"",  connected  to  Jabber  so  I  can  get  to  my  voicemail  or  make  calls  from  my  computer  if ""I m"",  away  from  a  phone  set. ""It s"",  pretty  easy  to  use,  has  a  nice  display.  For  our  adjunct  faculty,  it  is  nice  that  they  can  log  into  the  phone  and  then  log  off  when  they  are  gone,  since  they  use  shared  space  and  share  phones  with  one  another.

The most comprehensive IP communication solution on the market," Cisco  Unified  Communications  Manager  is  possibly  the  most  widely  used  IT  infrastructure  solution  across  our  company  by  far.  We  started  deploying  it  modestly,  in  2004,  for  a  small  portion  of  our  users  in  one  department,  and  for  some  IT  users.  Since  then,  we  started  to  increase  the  adoption,  mostly  when  we  had  new  departments  or  office  layout  changes,  where  it  was  easier  and  cheaper  to  deploy.  At  some  port,  we  also  started  to  deploy  it  in  remote  sites,  across  the  globe.  That  movement  allowed  us  to  have  a  seamless  phone  experience  and  allowed  our  users  to  communicate  across  the  globe.  The  US  office  could  easily  call  HQ  in  Brazil  without  any  cost  per  minute.  That  was  a  game-changer  and  allowed  us  to  promote  more  with  fast  communication  between  offices.  At  some  point,  we  decided  to  replace  all  the  old  TDM  PBXs  and  that  bunch  of  cables  for  the  small  and  simple  UCS  servers.  Besides  the  fact  that  it  saved  a  lot  of  real  estate  in  our  datacenter  also  saved  us  time  by  letting  us  administer  on  a  single  console.  Those  were  some  of  the  business  problems  we  solved  during  these  past  15  years  with  Cisco. "," The  solution  is  probably  one  of  the  most  robust  IT  solutions  we  have  today.  Although  it  works  24/7,  it  never  required  a  reset  ""just  because  it  needs  to  free  memory""  for  example.  In  our  deployment,  the  servers  never  went  down  due  to  a  bug  or  software/hardware  problem.  We  only  reboot  when  we  need  to  update  or  install  some  software  fix.Compared  to  other  platforms  on  the  market,  Cisco  Unified  Communications  Manager  is  the  most  complete  and  flexible  one.  You  can  manage  not  only  Cisco  endpoints  but  3rd  party  too.  Also,  you  can  run  on  bare  metal  appliances  or  even  in  virtualized  environments,  which  gives  you  more  freedom  of  choice.  Considering  the  amount  of  model  of  endpoints  available,  you  can  have  several  options  for  any  use  case,  from  the  simplest  no  display  desk  phone  to  a  wireless,  LCD  display,  full-featured  phone.  That  also  gives  you  the  freedom  to  select  what  works  best  in  each  environment.If  you  consider  both  statements  above, ""you ll"",  see  that  Cisco  Unified  Communications  Manager  as  the  best  ROI  on  the  market.  As  an  example,  I  can  say  that ""we re"",  running  instances  (both  hardware  and  software)  of  CUCM  for  the  last  5  years. ""That s"",  a  huge  advantage  if  you  compare  how  short  the  lifecycle  of  digital  platforms  are  these  days.  No  upgrades,  no  parts  replacement,  no  support  tickets,  no  TAC  calls,  nothing. "," Although  once  you  learn  how  to  use  the  management  interface  you  can  do  things  easily,  the  look  and  feel  of  the  management  interface  has  been  the  same  for  several  years. ""It s"",  not  as  modern  as  the  other  Cisco  platforms  and ""doesn t"",  follow  the  latest  design  language  we  see  in  other  systems.  Seems  like  it  got  stuck  in  the  past.In  our  architecture,  we  use  the  same  CUCM  servers  for  both  local  and  remote  deployment  because  Cisco ""doesn t"",  offer  a  version  for  branch  offices  that  is  small  enough  to  fit  both  in  our  infrastructure  and  budget.  I  know  they  offer  CUCM  Express,  which  is  a  simpler  and  more  affordable  version,  but ""it s"",  not  the  same  as  the  CUCM.  You ""can t"",  use  it  as  a  node  for  a  distributed  architecture.  It  only  runs  as  a  standalone  system.  From  a  management  perspective,  it  takes  a  little  more  to  support  those  kinds  of  mixed  environments.For  large  deployments,  when  you  need  to  replace  thousands  of  analog  desk  phones  for  new  IP  Phones,  as  our  company  did  in  the  past,  it  can  be  very  expensive. ""That s"",  why  it  took  several  years  until  we  reached  a  point  where  we  could  afford  to  replace  more  than  half  of  our  desk  phones  at  once.  The  investment  needed  had  to  be  substantial  and  sometimes ""it s"",  not  easy  to  justify  that  kind  of  investment  if ""you re"",  only  updating  the  technology.  As  a  manufacturing  company,  I  can  tell  you  that  for  the  person  who  uses  the  phone  on  the  floor,  it ""doesn t"",  matter  if  the  phone  is  analog  or  IP.  It  must  work  and ""that s"",  it.  Although  Cisco  offers  some  affordable  models, ""they re"",  limited.

Opinions on CUCM from a Genesys PureConnect Developer," Our  organization  is  using  CUCM  primarily  for  PBX  functionality  but  also  incorporating  the  end  user  management  for  Cisco  Jabber  and  some  auto  attendant  functionality  in  conjunction  with  UCCX.  We  are  late  in  the  process  of  transitioning  from  Avaya  to  Cisco  and  a  separate  contact  center  platform.  We  are  adopting  CUCM  throughout  our  entire  organization,  even  working  to  replace  remote  key  systems  with  the  primary  goal  of  having  centralized  support,  less  reliance  on  expensive  small  vendors  and  having  a  homogenized  environment,  simplifying  support. "," The  web  GUI  for  management  may  feel  a  bit  clunky  at  first  for  being  a  modern  application,  but  the  navigation  features  (back,  dependency  views)  quickly  differentiate  it  from  other  environments.Good  API  documentation  on  DEVNET  and  a  fairly  strong  supporting  community.It  plays  fairly  well  in  its  own  ecosystem  (UCCX,  IM  and  Presence,  Unity)  so  the  breadth  of  the  ecosystem  makes  for  a  lot  of  functionality  being  available  to  you  with  adjuncts. "," The  AXL  API  for  Call  Manager  feels  particularly  dated.  The  fact  that  it ""hasn t"",  been  deprecated  for  a  more  modern  REST/JSON  supporting  API  is  a  little ""lackluster.CUCM s"",  solution  to  elements  missing  API  coverage  is  to  open  SQL  queries  via  the  API.

This  creates  a  barrier  to  learning  the  ecosystem  that  just ""doesn t"",  feel  necessary.The  dial  plan  feels  dated,  clunky  and  almost  indecipherable  compared  to  some  more  streamlined  applications.

CUCM isn't just for Call Routing! Route your faxes and even manage PA Systems!," Cisco  Unified  Communications  Manager  (CUCM)  Call  Manager  is  used  to  manage  all  our  phone  numbers  throughout  our  organization.  Additionally,  it  is  used  to  route  a  portion  of  fax  numbers  to  our  e  Fax  server  (Stone  Fax)  as  well  as  a  recent  implementation  of  Informacast  which  is  used  as  our  PA  system  at  our  school  sites.  It  routes  all  our  calls,  digital  and  analog  throughout  our  whole  school  district. "," Ease  of  reporting.  Able  to  obtain  bulk  reporting  on  current  extensions  assigned  by  location,  which  is  very  helpful  to  us  as  we  have  21  different  school  sites.  It  makes  it  easier  to  manage  when  we  are  working  on  particular  projects.Extension  Mobility  is  a  very  awesome  feature  of  CUCM  that  allows  users  to  login  to  any  phone  on  our  network  with  their  own  extension.  This  has  served  particularly  well  with  our  school  counselors  that  roam  to  different  school  sites. ""It s"",  easier  for  them  to  provide  staff  and  parents  one  phone  number  to  contact  them  at,  as  opposed  to  several  numbers  from  all  the  sites  they  visit.Cisco  Meet  Me  is  another  awesome  addition  within  the  CUCM  that  allows  for  conference  calling  within  our  own  phone  system.  No  need  to  purchase  a  3rd  party  phone  conferencing  when  it  can  be  implemented  within  your  own  infrastructure.  It  is  extremely  easy  to  configure  and  has  been  very  beneficial  for  the  executive  staff  in  our  district. "," CUCM  can  improve  by  actually  showing  the  administrator  which  DID  numbers  are  available  for  use.  We  have  a  large  block  of  DID  numbers  provided  by  AT&T,  but  when  configuring  them  on  the  phone  system  we  have  no  idea  which  ones  are  actually  available  for  use.  The  worst  thing  is,  if ""it s"",  not  configured  on  call  manager  BUT  it  is  being  used  as  a  voicemail  line  on  Cisco  unity,  I  have  no  idea  until  I  cross  check  the  number  on  the  Unity  Server. ""It s"",  really  cumbersome  having  to  go  back  and  forth  between  unity  and  CUCM  to  ensure ""I m"",  actually  configuring  an  available  phone  number.Improvement  with  CUCM  and  Unity  configuration.  Having  to  configure  phone  numbers  and  voicemails  on  two  separate  systems  wastes  a  lot  of  time.  And  there  have  been  times  where  a  phone  number  had  been  configured,  but  we  forgot  to  attach  the  voicemail  inbox  to  it,  leaving  the  user  without  voicemails.  I  hope  this  can  be  improved  in  the  future. ""I m"",  not  against  having  two  separate  systems,  but  I  wish  there  was  a  better  way  to  integrate  the  two  especially  when  it  comes  to  voicemail  management.Improve  on  the  User  Interface.  If  you  have  no  familiarity  with  CUCM,  it  is  extremely  hard  to  navigate  and  find  the  settings  that  you  need.  Unfortunately  I  did  not  receive  much  training,  but  the  system ""wasn t"",  that  intuitive  to  be  able  to  navigate  easily.

Review of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM)," We  use  CUCM  to  manage  our  Cisco  phone  environment  of  roughly  1200  phones.  This  includes  roughly  100  emergency  phones  of  various  types.  We  integrate  directly  with  Exchange  2016  for  Unified  Communication,  which  allows  voicemail  to  go  directly  to  the ""user s"",  inbox.  (We  do  not  use  Unity.)  We  have  around  half  dozen  IP  phone  models  (7941/42,  6921,  etc.). "," It  is  good  at  allowing  for  specific  phone  configurations.  If  you  want  to  get  granular,  this  is  the  tool  for  you.The  single  number  reach  feature  works  well,  allowing  simultaneous  ringing  to  outside  devices,  such  as  a  mobile  phone  or  home  phone.The  Cisco  IP  Communicator  application  is  great.  I  use  it  every  day  to  emulate  my  physical  phone  from  my  laptop.  I  have  used  it  extensively  when  working  from  home  or  at  our  co-location  where  cell  service  is  not  available.  I  just  connect  to  the  company  VPN,  launch  the  application,  and  use  the  phone  just  like  it  was  on  my  desk.  It  even  looks  the  same. "," The  user  interface  is  not  intuitive;  if  you ""don t"",  know  what  you  are  doing,  a  single,  small  change  can  become  a  major  problem.Provisioning  a  single  device  requires  lots  of  clicks  and  manual  input  of  data;  easy  to  misspell  something  by  accident.I  find  the  provisioning  process  to  be  rather  time  consuming,  but  that  may  be  because  unified  communications  is  not  my  primary  role.CUCM  is  not  particularly  friendly  to  non-Cisco  hardware;  you  can  configure  other  makes  (we  use  Polycom  for  conference  phones),  but  the  configuration  process  is  pretty  involved,  and  requires  time  and  experience.

Quick review of Cisco DNAC," We  have  a  first  generation  appliance  and  have  it  in  our  lab/staging  environment.  Currently,  we  are  using  the  1.2.10  version  of  the  DNA  Center  software.  I  would  say  that  the  initial  installation  was  difficult  with  issues  getting  the  10GE  Enterprise  Port  connected  to  a  DC  Catalyst  3850  Switch.  We  tried  Trunk  and  Access  mode  and  two  different  Cisco  switches  and  could  not  get  that  port  up  and  running.  We  finally  got  the  appliance  setup  via  1GE  port  but  being  a  lab  that  was  fine.  We  will  most  likely  re-image  the  box  when  1.3  becomes  available.  On  the  whole  I  like  DNAC  with  features  like  software  image  management  and  Assurance  being  invaluable  to  a  network  engineer.  Once  you  get  Cisco  ISE  integrated  you  can  get  full  analytics  and  telemetry  information  based  on  identity  across  the  network.  SDA  or  Software  Defined  Access  is  a  new  way  or  even  a  paradigm  shift  in  creating  a  campus  LAN.  It  requires  full  Cisco  ISE  integration  utilizing ""SGT s"",  for  user/device  on-boarding.  I  really  like  the  fact  that  a  policy  applies  to  that  user  or  device  no  matter  where  or  how  they  connect  to  the  network.  I  would  say  that  extending  a  fabric  to  other  sites  say  over  a  WAN  is  still  kind  of  a  gray  area  with  little  documentation  or  best  practices  available  yet.

The  aim  from  the  beginning  was  to  only  use  Cisco  DNA  Center  to  provision  any  settings  to  the  wireless  environment,  which  has  caused  some  issues  since  not  everything  we  need  is  available  in  Cisco  DNA  Center.

It  is  currently  addressing  the  issue  of  having  historical  data  and  information  when  attempting  to  troubleshoot  endpoints,  but  we  hope  to  use  provisioning  to  automatically  deploy  devices  without  having  to  have  a  trained  on-site  presence  in  the  near  future.

"DNA Center - When it's good, it's really good... where it's bad, it's really bad"," We,  as  a  Cisco  partner,  install  Cisco  DNA  Center  for  our  customers  as  well  as  in  our  lab.  We  have  been  with  it  since  the  earlier  1.1  on  the  M4  server  (we  got  our  server  after  the  issue  with  the  partitioning  on  the  hard  drives),  and  dealt  with  many  of  the  bugs  throughout  1.2,  and  are  currently  on  1.2.8.  We  have  evaluates  the  auto-provision  and  Pn  P  functionality,  SD-Access  with  fabric  at  a  single  site,  API  and  API  integrations  with  custom  software,  and  Assurance  modules  both  within  DNA  Center  and  integrated  into  ticketing  systems. "," Pn  P  is  absolutely  amazing.  The  idea  that  the  server  need  only  boot  up  and  get  a  DHCP  address  (with  DNS  or  Option  43)  greatly  increases  the  deployment  speeds,  especially  tying  to  golden  standard  images  and  configuration  templates.API  documentation  and  integration  is  better  than  any  other  Cisco  product  I  have  seen,  and  in  the  top  3  of  any  product  I  have  worked  with.  The  Developer  toolkit  was  able  to  not  only  show  configuration  examples,  but  also  show  you  the  actual  feedback  from  that  call  to  assist  in  quality  testing.ISE  integration  with  the  auto-provisioning  makes  a  zero-touch  deployment  seemless  across  multiple  platforms.  Having  the  DNA  Center  contact  the  ISE  environment  greatly  assists  in  speed-to-deployment  of  new  gear.The  overall  UI  is  very  intuitive  and  walks  you  through  each  piece  of  a  new  deployment.  Whereas  in  products  like  ISE,  I  always  talk  about  working  backwards  (define  the  result,  the  conditions,  and  then  add  to  policy  -  but  the  tabs  are  listed  in  reverse  order),  DNA  Center  provides  the  step-by-step  boxes  to  take  a  new  deployment  to  a  fabric-enabled  campus  to  assurance  and  monitoring.The  configuration  templates,  with  ability  to  add  variables,  allow  engineers  to  create  the  one  golden  standard  configuration  for  a  particular  switch  type,  and  supply  the  variables  to  that  particular  switch.  This  has  been  a  large  limiting  factors  with  many  customers,  as  the  templates  were  not  dynamic  enough.The  Pn  P  holding  area  for  switches  allows  the  switches  to  boot  up  and  contact  DNA  Center,  but  will  sit  in  an  unprovisioned  state  until  ready.Allowing  templates  to  only  be  available  for  particular  network  devices  or  line  of  network  devices  prevents  engineers  clicking  without  thinking. "," The  DNA  Center  provides  a  dot1X  configuration  to  the  switch  that  I  have  never  seen  before.  It  seems  overly  complex  and  may  be  hard  to  troubleshoot  from  the  CLI.Documentation  needs  to  be  much  more  available  through  the  Cisco  website.  Contacting  TAC  for  every  issue  and  upgrade  is  quite  honestly  unacceptable.  Calling  TAC  undermines  the  trust  of  a  product  and  I  have  had  customers  steer  away  from  DNAC  for  that  exact  reason.Explaining  the  DNA  Center  ""magic""  to  CLI  needs  to  be  documented  in  much  greater  detail.  When  I  hit  the  bug  in  1.2.6  which  evaporated  my  fabric,  I  was  desperate  to  get  it  back  up.  It  was  an  issue  with  my  LISP  underlay,  but  unfortunately,  I ""didn t"",  know  LISP  at  the  time.  Again,  this  is  increasing  the  fear  with  the  customer  base  (especially  the  senior  engineers),  who  need  to  know  ""what  happens  when  DNAC  goes  down"".Cisco  continues  to  push  customers  to  their  in-house  resources  with  their  seeding  programs.  This  makes  it  difficult  as  a  partner  to  sell  services  with  DNA  Center  to  assist.  In  one  instance,  we  worked  with  the  customer  for  3  days  on  their  DNA  Center,  and  when  we  went  to  make  a  service  sales  attempt,  we  were  cut  short  by  the  Cisco  SE  saying  ""don\ t  forget  you  get  a  free  X  number  of  hours  with  our  team"".  What  is  our  motivation  for  being  so  invested  if  Cisco  seeds  the  device  and  the  services?  We  are  not  making  any  money  on  the  deals.I  am  hopeful  about  the  1.3  train,  but  1.2  was  so  plagued  with  bugs  that  customers  were  jumping  minor  releases  way  too  often.  The  same  problem  happened  with  Firepower.  I  am  not  sure  if  these  were  not  unit  tested  because  there ""wasn t"",  enough  resources  or  time,  but  jumping  from  failed  minor  release  to  failed  minor  release  is  a  great  way  for  customers  to  lose  faith  in  the  product.The  documentation  of  what  the  initial  set-up  *does*  needs  to  be  better  documented.  There  are  4  ports,  but  only  2  are  necessary  (cluster  and  enterprise).  This  needs  to  be  better  explained  that  only  one  interface  can  get  a  default  route,  so  that  needs  to  be  taken  into  account.  Also,  why  the  service  subnets  exist  needs  to  be  better  explained.  I  have  dealt  with  way  too  many  customers  who  fumble  past  the  address  space  needed  for  DNA  Center  because  no  one  puts  on  the  web  site  ""these  are  tunneled  IPs  used  by  Docker.""  Again  -  very  poor  public  documentation  is  available.DNA  Center  needs  to  be  advertised  as  what  it  is.  It  is  an  absolutely  amazing  product,  which  needs  ISE  for  the  SDA.  For  ETA,  Stealthwatch  can  report  back  to  ISE.  That  has  nothing  to  do  with  DNA  Center.  This  is  only  causing  confusion.  When  I  finally  de-tangle  the  Cisco  products  for  a  customer,  they  generally  are  willing  to  sign  off  on  more  of  the  products  than  the  campaign  of  DNAC,  ISE,  Stealthwatch,  Threat-Grid,  Firepower,  and  Cat9K  -or-  nothing.

We  were  able  to  view  what  percentage  of  users  visited/clicked  thru  with  the  device  and  time  of  day.  We  were  also  able  to  see  their  drop  point.  Immediately  saw  a  trend  and  got  our  app  team  on  it.  After  that,  we  saw  an  almost  immediate  uptick  with  our  business  partners.

This  makes  it  difficult  for  small  businesses  to  enter.Functionality  is  overkill  for  most  small  to  midsize  businesses  (SMBs).  When  stacking  up  product  units,  it  can  get  pricey  for  enterprises  as  well.With  fine  granular  configs  and  customizations  available,  it  will  also  mean  that  it  is  very  complicated  and  requires  a  certain  amount  of  knowledge  before  we  can  make  full  use  of  all  features  in  the  product.

Think your application has no issues? Think again and try AppDynamics APM tool!," Our  application  is  costing  and  contracting  modeling  software.  The  application  involves  very  extensive  calculations  that  are  very  CPU  intensive  on  the  app  server-side  as  well  as  on  the  database  server.  These  calculations  are  pretty  complex  queries  that  needed  optimization  as  they  generally  take  several  hours.  We  brought  in  an  APM  tool  to  look  further  into  these  transactions  to  improve  the  performance.  After  exploring  a  couple  of  products,  we  decided  to  go  with  App  Dynamics.  It  is  currently  used  by  just  our  department. "," Ease  of  setup,  with  pretty  extensive  documentation.App  Dynamics  has  several  components  to  monitor  applications,  physical  server  resources,  database  servers,  and  networking.  The  fact  that  all  of  them  are  independent  of  each  other  makes  it  convenient  to  start/stop  these  services  as  needed  in  production.The  support  team  is  very  knowledgeable  in  the  product  and  provides  the  necessary  help  from  the  initial  setup  to  the  final  setup  in  production. "," Generally  speaking,  App  Dynamics  serves  the  purpose  we  initially  intended  this  product  to  do.  However,  there  are  certain  limitations  to  how  our  application  works.  App  Dynamics  was  likely  built  for  monitoring  applications  that  handle  hundreds  and  thousands  of  transactions  such  as  an  ecommerce  application,  and  so  is  limited  in  how  a  baseline  can  be  set  up  as  it  pertains  to  our  product.  Ours  does  not  deal  with  so  many  transactions  in  a  given  amount  of  time  but  every  transaction  has  sub-transactions  it  performs.  So,  while  using  a  Saa  S  model  to  setup  business  transactions,  we  are  limited  to  what  the  cloud  server  is  configured  to  and  is  not  customizable.

Cisco Meraki MX Firewalls Review," The  Meraki  MX  is  being  used  by  the  entire  company.  The  main  challenge  that  we  face  in  the  company  is  the  administration  of  the  equipment  and  the  configurations  that  must  be  carried  out.  Meraki  Dashboard  is  a  very  intuitive  interface  to  solve  any  implementation  in  minutes.  Being  able  to  give  low  technical  users  control  of  a  platform  via  web  is  a  very  good  tool  to  reduce  the  costs  of  subcontracting  whenever  a  change  is  needed.  Seeing  how  customers  decide  to  continue  migrating  their  network  to  Meraki  based  on  their  own  experience  is  a  plus  point  that  is  used  as  a  sales  tool.Integration  in  the  cloud  with  the  security  products  that  Cisco  sells  is  a  great  advantage  to  enhance  the  visibility  and  protection  of  internal  customers.  Being  able  to  see  the  use  of  traffic  by  each  of  the  internal  users  is  a  highly  appreciated  feature,  since  we  can  control  the  budgets  of  the  ISPs  in  each  of  the  offices.  Filtering  applications,  managing  the  bandwidth  of  each  of  the  allowed  applications  makes  the  network  a  living  and  controlled  element.  Low  energy  consumption  and  it  takes  up  little  space  used  in  the  cabinets  where  it  is  installed,  which  helps  with  savings  in  all  aspects  of  the  institution.  Just  because ""it s"",  a  small  team ""doesn t"",  mean ""it s"",  weak.  We  have  the  ability  to  be  placed  in  High  Availability,  support  GSM  connections  through  USB.

Meraki MX Firewalls are a game-changer, We  use  Cisco  Meraki  MX  Firewalls  to  create  VPN  connectivity  between  sites.

Meraki MX Appliances are awesome for small to medium-sized business," We  use  Meraki  MX  appliances  as  the  primary  firewall  at  each  of  our  15  locations.  Meraki  MX  appliances  are  not  just  firewalls,  they  are  a  way  to  create  a  network  ""mesh""  without  having  to  know  arcane  engineering  skills  like  you  would  need  for  most  advanced  firewalls.  Meraki  MX  firewalls  are  a  really  good  choice  for  a  small  to  medium-sized  enterprise  that  has  limited  engineering  staff,  because  even  a  moderately  experienced  generalist  can  deploy  and  maintain  these  devices  without  the  need  for  very  advanced  networking  skills. "," Meraki  MXs  are  simply  great  at  being  easy  to  setup,  deploy  and  maintain  without  advanced  skills.  They  are  so  simple  to  use  that  one  can  just  plug  them  in,  give  them  a  few  IP  addresses  and  ranges  and  they  work.Meraki  MX  appliances  are  compact  and  fit  in  a  single  rack  unit  (1U)  space,  and  they  consume  less  electricity  and  generate  less  heat  than  similarly-sized  (as  far  as  capacity  goes)  devices.Meraki  MXs  have  a  cloud  control  panel  (like  other  Meraki  devices  do)  that  is  very  easy  to  understand.  If  you ""don t"",  understand  it,  their  support  and  customer  success  account  managers  are  right  there  to  help. "," Meraki  MXs  are  not  inexpensive.  They  cost  quite  a  bit  more  than  your  average  sonicwall  or  watchguard.Like  all  Meraki  devices,  if  you  stop  paying  the  subscription  (which  is  their  entire  license  model)  you  can  no  longer  manage  the  device.  For  Meraki,  subscription  is  equal  to  use  license.Meraki  MX ""can t"",  do  everything  that  a  full-blown  Cisco  ASA  can  do  and ""that s"",  because  the  user ""can t"",  program  every  feature  that  they  have.  For  some  very  advanced  firewall  features  you  might  have  to  open  a  ticket  with  Meraki  support  and  have  them  add  a  configuration  setting  for  you  using  the  command  line,  which  users  do  not  have  full  access  to.  Even  then,  we  have  found  that  there  are  some  advanced  settings  that  they  simply ""can t"",  do.  Steer  clear  if  you  have  a  very  large,  complex  environment  that  needs  and  advanced  firewall.  For  that ""you ll"",  need  a  Palo  Alto  or  a  large  Forti  Gate,  something  like  that.

Gateway Security Nirvana," We  installed  the  Cisco  Meraki  MX  Firewall  about  two  years  ago,  replacing  a  Dell  Sonic  Wall  2600.  It  is  the  gateway  for  redundant  Internet  connections  for  our  organization  and  consolidates  in  a  single  device  SD-WAN,  traffic  shaping,  threat  protection,  access  control,  content  filtering,  and  routing.  It  works  seamlessly  with  the  Meraki  switches  and  wireless  APs  that  I  have  on  my  network,  giving  me  a  comprehensive,  cloud-based  view  of  my  entire  network  from  a  single  dashboard.  Before  I  had  to  log  in  to  the  firewall,  switches,  and  APs  separately  (by  device,  no  less)  to  monitor,  configure,  and  update  them,  and  I  had  to  be  on  the  network  to  do  it.  Now  from  one  browser  tab,  and  from  anywhere,  there  is  a  secure  Internet  connection,  I  can  monitor,  configure,  and  update  my  network. "," Provides  for  a  comprehensive,  graphical  view  of  LAN  and  WAN  status,  including  bandwidth  consumption  over  time.The  security  center  allows  you  to  view  affected  clients  and  the  threats  that  were  levied  against  them.  You  can  configure  the  system  to  email  reports.  I  have  one  waiting  for  me  in  my  inbox  every  morning,  so  I  can  review  the  activity  of  the  previous  day.  For  real-time  views,  I  can  simply  access  the  dashboard.The  content  filtering  is  easy  to  configure  and  works  extremely  well.  Traffic  shaping  allows  you  prioritize  traffic  on  the  network,  such  as  VOIP  and  video  conferencing,  while  limiting  others,  such  as  social  media  and  music  streaming  services.  You  can  also  assign  flow  preferences  by  VLAN;  for  example,  I  channel  VOIP  traffic  through  a  separate  WAN  interface  from  all  other  traffic.The  device  makes  it  easy  to  configure  VLANs,  by  which  you  assign  uplinks  and  bandwidth  limitations  and  also  provide  addressing  via  DHCP.I  have  appreciated  the  lengths  to  which  Cisco  has  gone  to  document  the  Meraki  product  line.  And  when  that ""hasn t"",  sufficed,  the  Meraki  tech  support  has  been  incredible.  They  will  log  in  to  your  network  and  help  you  get  things  properly  configured  if  there  is  an  issue  or  you  want  to  make  changes. "," I  purchased  the  Meraki  Insight  product,  which  allows  for  an  extra  layer  of  monitoring  of  what  is  happening  on  your  network  and  monitors  connectivity  to  other  networks.  It  also  allows  you  to  set  alerts  for  when  your  network,  your ""ISP s"",  network,  or  the  remote  connection  is  having  an  issue.  This  is  extremely  helpful,  but  I  feel  this  should  be  included  in  the  base  product  considering  the  price  of  the  support  package.It  is  designed  to  work  with  other  Meraki  products.  If  you  install  this  product  but  your  switches,  APs,  cameras,  etc,  are  from  another  vendor,  you  will  be  missing  out  on  the  integrations  and  insights  that  come  from  managing  your  network  from  a  single,  cloud-based  dashboard.

Cisco Meraki MX Security Appliances Review," We  use  Meraki  MX  as  a  security  appliance/firewall.  With  an  advanced  security  license,  the  content  filtering,  IDS,  and  geographical  blocking  features  are  surprisingly  good  compared  to  using  alternative  solutions  with  no  noticeable  performance  hit  as  long  as  you  size  the  unit  properly.  The  geographical  blocking  is  a  great  security  feature  but  you  have  to  use  with  planning.  I’ve  managed  to  block  a  few ""vendors "",  websites  and  mail  servers  without  realizing  what  country  those  vendors  were  located  in.  When  you’re  not  use  to  having  geographical  blocking  the  first  time  I  I  had  that  problem  it  took  a  while  to  troubleshoot  why  the  connectivity  was  missing.  Sorta  over  secured  myself.  Not  the  MX’s  fault. "," The  dashboard  brings  all  management  features  with  you  wherever  you  are.  All  you  need  is  an  Internet  connection  and  a  browser  and  you  can  manage  the  solution.  The  dashboard  tracks  your  uplink  connectivity  to  the  dashboard  and  double  checks  with  you  all  changes  impacting  the  connectivity,  making  it  much  safer  to  enact  changes  remotely.  Dual  WAN  connections  are  greatly  simplified  and  site-to-site  VPNs  automatically  connect  regardless  of  what  WAN  connection  is  active.Site-to-Site  VPNs  are  the  easier  to  setup  than  any  other  vendor’s  solution.  You  simple  pick  two  or  more  devices  to  tunnel  together  and  then  select  what  network  subsets  should  be  allowed  to  cross  the  tunnel  and  you  are  done.  The  solution  handles  all  the  details.  Site-to-site  VPNs  can  dynamically  follow  IP  changes  with  no  need  for  static  IPs.For  MSPs  the  dashboard  is  even  more  convenient  as  all  your  clients  are  on  the  same  MSP  account.  Switching  between  managing  different  clients  Meraki  equipment  is  a  few  clicks  once  you  login  to  the  dashboard.  Two-factor  authentication  is  available  for  enhanced  dashboard  security. "," Some  advanced  enterprise  features  are  missing,  but  for  SMBs  this  solution  is  a  dream  to  deploy  and  manage.  Complex  environments  should  look  elsewhere,  but  I  personally  have  not  ran  across  anything  that  Meraki  has  not  been  able  to  handle  so  far.  On  the  dashboard  is  a  “Make  a  Wish”  button  to  request  new  features.  In  three  years,  I  have  made  three  wishes  and  they  were  all  were  granted.

Cisco Meraki MX Series Review," Like  many  organizations  after  time  your  firewalls  eventually  become  outdated  and  outgunned  by  current  gen  threats.  We  found  ourselves  in  this  situation  a  couple  of  years  ago  and  after  doing  some  research  settled  on  the  Cisco  Meraki  MX  Firewall  series.  As  of  right  now  we  only  have  one  but  we  are  looking  at  possibly  adding  them  to  our  other  facilities  as  they  age.  I  highly  recommend  purchasing  the  Advanced  Security  License  as  that  adds  content  filtering,  anti-virus  scanning  and  intrusion  detection.  We  saw  a  huge  drop  in  virus  and  malware  infections  right  after  upgrading  our  license. ""We ve"",  been  very  happy  with  the  purchase  overall. "," Easy  to  set  up  and  maintain.

Umbrella Review - Keeping the Rain Out of Your Network.," First  -  Cisco  Umbrella  used  to  be  called  Open  DNS.  Cisco  bought  them.  And  of  course  had  to  rename  it  -  especially  since  it  had  OPEN  in  the  name.  LOL!  I  work  as  the  director  of  IT  for  a  mid  sized  architectural  firm.  The  architects  were  used  to  going  about  anywhere  they  wanted  on  the  web  and  when  I  started  here  I  knew  I  had  to  find  a  way  to  ""protect""  them  without  being  too  pushy.  Open  DNS,  aka  Umbrella  has  been  a  lifesaver.  Using  their  selection  list  I  was  able  to  whittle  down  the  content  available  to  my  users  while  still  having  the  ability  to  customize  and  whitelist  sites  they  needed  to  have  access  to.  This  product  -  in  case  you ""don t"",  know  -  filters  traffic  at  the  DNS  level.  They  have  whitelist/blacklist  DNS  entries  and  for  the  most  part  it  is  totally  transparent  and  extremely  fast. "," Filters  content  at  the  DNS  level.

Meraki - Ease of management.," Meraki  Access  Points  are  used  across  our  entire  organization,  including  multiple  departments.  One  of  the  main  reasons  I  like  Meraki  is  that  it  is  all  managed  through  the  cloud.

Meraki Makes Wireless Easy and Fun," If  you  read  my  other  reviews  of  Cisco  Meraki  products,  you  will  know  I  am  an  unabashed  lover  of  Meraki  cloud-managed  networking.  Just  like  the  switches  and  firewall  products  I  use,  the  Meraki  access  points  (AP)  offer  incredible  ease  of  installation,  configuration,  management,  and  monitoring.  I  use  two  of  these  to  blanket  our  office  in  Wi  Fi,  and  users  are  always  ensured  of  the  best  Wi  Fi  experience  as  they  move  around  the  office  because  the  APs  automatically  switch  devices  to  the  AP  with  the  strongest  signal  for  their  locations.  Users  are  presented  with  a  single  SSID  regardless  of  the  number  of  APs  present,  solving  the  issue  of  the  user  having  to  move  their  device  to  a  new  AP  when  the  old  one  is  out  of  range  as  they  move.  Just  like  all  the  Meraki  products  on  my  account,  I  can  configure  and  monitor  them  from  a  single  dashboard. "," You  can  advertise  up  to  15  SSIDs,  enabling  different  networks  for  different  audiences  and  purposes,  each  with  their  own  splash  pages,  if  desired.  Used  in  concert  with  a  Meraki  firewall,  you  can  apply  traffic  shaping  rules  independently  for  each  network.  For  example,  devices  I  issue  to  my  employees  enjoy  unlimited  Wi  Fi  bandwidth,  while  guest  users  access  a  network  with  bandwidth  restrictions.You  can  channel  SSIDs  to  use  different  WANs,  too.  So  my  employees  get  Wi  Fi  access  through  our  fiber  connection,  while  guest  traffic  is  shuttled  through  a  separate  copper  connection.  Not  only  is  this  good  from  a  security  perspective,  but  it  means  employees ""don t"",  have  to  compete  with  guests  for  network  bandwidth  (and  vice  versa).Meraki  allows  you  to  build  maps  of  your  locations  in  the  dashboard  using  an  uploaded  floor  plan,  upon  which  you  can  precisely  place  your  Meraki  hardware.  From  this  map,  you  can  see  how  many  devices  are  on  each  AP  and  then  drill  down  to  see  which  devices  these  are—how  cool  is  that?  With  the  location  heatmap,  you  actually  see  where  devices  are  physically  located  on  the  floor  plans.There  are  eight  different  authentication  options  available,  including  paid  access,  which  allow  you  various  control  mechanisms  for  each  network  you  create.  So  you  can  offer  a  free  tier  for  one  network  and  a  paid  tier  for  another,  offering  paying  users  a  higher-performing  option,  for  instance.You  can  choose  to  make  certain  networks  a  part  of  your  LAN,  getting  DHCP  leases  from  domain  controllers  and  allowing  Wi  Fi  clients  to  seamlessly  interact  with  wired  clients.  Other  clients,  such  as  guests,  can  get  leases  through  Meraki  DHCP.  In  NAT  mode,  you  can  also  conduct  content  filtering.You  can  also  track  and  monitor  Bluetooth  clients  on  your  network.  In  short,  you  can  see  just  about  any  wireless  device,  which  makes  these  APs  really  useful  for  security  monitoring.One  of  my  favorite  features  is  being  able  to  monitor  network  health  by  bandwidth  type,  such  as  distinguishing  between  video  and  voice.  Meraki  is  constantly  adding  features  to  the  dashboard,  and  this  recent  addition  is  much  appreciated. "," I  honestly ""can t"",  think  of  a  single  thing  I ""don t"",  like  about  these  APs  or  the  Meraki  software.  Note  that  the  capabilities  of  these  APs  will  be  diminished  if  you  are  not  using  them  in  concert  with  a  Meraki  Firewall,  so  keep  that  in  mind  when  making  your  purchasing  decision.Also,  note  that  the  hardware  becomes  uses  without  product  licenses.  Since  these  are  cloud-managed  devices,  you  have  to  have  a  license  to  continue  to  use  them.  If  you ""don t"",  want  to  get  locked  into  annual  renewal  costs,  these  are  not  the  products  for  you.

"The most reliable, powerful and flexible Wireless Controller on the market"," Cisco  Wireless  LAN  Controllers  are  being  used  since  9  years  ago,  when  we  moved  from  a  small  deployment  of  20  or  so  access-points  being  controlled  by  1  single  master  AP,  autonomous  AP  architecture  to  a  new  approach  called  LWAPP  architecture,  where  the  Wireless  LAN  controller  manages  and  controls  all  the  AP  in  the  campus.  For  us,  it  meant  we  had  a  huge  leap  in  administration  and  allowed  us  to  increase  the  adoption  of  the  Wi  Fi  technology,  going  from  20  to  300  AP  along  the  last  9  years,  using  the  same  controller.  Besides  that,  we  could  improve  availability  having  2  controllers  working  simultaneously.  Last,  but  not  least,  we  could  serve  several  remote  offices  with  the  same  controllers,  hosted  in  our  HQ. "," Centralized  configuration  and  management  is  something  that  Cisco  Wireless  LAN  Controllers  does  very  well.  You  just  need  to  do  the  basic  setup  and  once  you  connect  a  new  AP  to  the  network,  it  seeks  the  controller,  downloads  the  most  updated  firmware,  configuration  and ""that s"",  it.  For  big  deployments,  it  means  a  lot  of  work  hours  saved  and  deployment  time  reduced.As  we  see  in  several  Cisco  products, ""it s"",  no  different  in  this  case.  Cisco  Wireless  LAN  Controllers  are  so  robust  and  stable  that  you  almost  forget  they  exist  in  your  infrastructure.  They  are  designed  to  support  thousands  of  users,  hundreds  of  access-points.  Its  software  is  always  evolving  also.  We  started,  9  years  ago,  with  a  software  version  that  was  updated  several  times,  always  adding  new  features  and  technologies  like  fast  roaming,  for  example,  running  in  the  exact  same  hardware  from  9  years  ago.The  same  Wireless  LAN  controller  can  be  used  for  multiple  kinds  of  deployments,  because  the  hardware  is  so  powerful  and  the  software  is  so  flexible  that  you  can  deploy  enterprise  networks  and  guest  networks  at  the  same  time,  thanks  to  segmentation,  multiple  network  interfaces,  captive  portal,  etc. "," There  was  one  missing  functionality  that  was  very  important:  the  ability  to  update  the  software  without  having  to  reboot  the  controller.  Luckily,  since  the  recent  launch  of  the  Catalyst  9800  series,  it  was  solved.The  management  interface,  at  least  for  old  models, ""didn t"",  receive  and  update  since  it  was  launched,  so  we  miss  some  of  the  new  interface  elements  we  see  in  other  products.  It  was  also  addressed  in  later  hardware  launches,  but  for  old  models, ""it s"",  still  a  small  fault.Depending  on  the  size  of  your  deployment,  you  may  think  that  the  cost  of  the  Cisco  Wireless  LAN  Controllers  can  be  a  little  high.  Just  keep  in  mind  that  the  equipment  will  survive  for  a  long  time,  so  if  you  had  a  chance  to  invest  in  this,  I  think  it  worth  the  money.

We  started  selecting  some  meeting  rooms  that  had  a  potential  need  for  videoconference  and  deployed  the  video  endpoints  in  those  rooms.

Best Video Collaboration Solution Available - Cisco Spark Room Series, I  was  first  introduced  to  Cisco  Spark  Room  kits  during  the  Cisco  Live  2017.  We  purchased  our  first  unit  about  a  month  later.  This  was  set  up  for  one  of  our  smaller  remote  office  around  10  people.  The  technology  built  into  this  unit  is  amazing  and  setup  was  a  breeze.  We  have  multiple  other  models  of  Cisco  Telepresence  systems  and  by  far  this  has  been  the  best  unit  Cisco  has  developed.  Video  conferencing  is  becoming  essential  to  the  way  we  do  business.  With  many  teams  and  remote  offices  this  is  a  way  to  bring  everyone  together  to  collaborate  on  ideas  and  solutions. , The  Cisco  Spark  Room  series  has  many  new  technologies  that  make  this  unit  well  worth  the  purchase.  The  auto  room  framing  feature  makes  manual  zoom  and  focus  a  thing  of  the  past.  The  unit  will  auto  zoom  and  pan  to  frame  the  screen  around  a  single  person  in  a  conference  room  or  zoom  out  and  capture  the  whole  room  if  there  are  multiple  people  in  the  conference.  The  Cisco  Spark  Room  series  also  has  an  active  speaker  tracking  system  that  will  track  users  in  the  room  and  pan  and  zoom  when  that  person  is  speaking.The  Cisco  Spark  Room  series  units  can  be  cloud  or  on-premise  registered  taking  advantage  of  whichever  platform  best  suits  your  needs  and  current  investments.When  the  Cisco  Spark  Room  series  units  are  attached  to  4K  TVs  or  monitors  you  get  the  best  possible  resolution  for  video  viewing  with  crystal  clear  presentations. , Cost  may  be  only  con  that  I  can  see  when  cloud  registered.  I  believe  the  average  subscription  cost  is  around  $99  per  month  and  depending  on  how  often  the  device  gets  used  this  can  extend  your  ROI. ,30-Jan-18,9 out of 10,Brian Munn,Network Services Manager,Construction,1001-5000 employees

Cisco USC servers are the only choice for Cisco CUCM cluster hosts," Cisco  UCS  servers  are  the  underlying  host  servers  for  our  Cisco  CUCM  (voice  /  conferencing  /  meeting  /  chat  services)  clusters  both  for  our  publisher  CUCM  cluster  and  our  subscriber  CUCM  cluster.

""Doesn t"",  matter  how  many  models  of  the  same  equipment  you  have.The  Network  Topology  map  is  also  a  great  tool  for  troubleshooting.  You  can  check  several  aspects  of  the  topology,  the  connection  between  the  equipment,  the  status  of  the  connections  and  even  check  specific  alarms  related  to  that  part  of  the  topology  (or  map).  Again,  consider  that  in  a  multi  site,  global  environment  and ""you ll"",  see  the  benefits.Inventory  and  firmware  updates  are  also  great  tools  inside  the  solution.  You  have  check  exactly  what  equipment  is  outdated  and  schedule  an  update  with  a  couple  of  clicks.  You  can  do  that  also  in  a  batch,  saving  a  lot  of  time  (and  money)  and  avoid  to  go  handle  the  equipment  one  by  one,  sometimes  even  needing  to  have  physical  access  to  those  equipment. "," Maps.  One  thing  that  I  miss  is  the  fact  that  you ""can t"",  see  both  wired  and  wireless  equipment  in  the  same  topology  map.  For  visualization  and  troubleshooting  purposes,  that  would  help  a  lot,  and  I  honestly ""don "",  t  think ""it s"",  that  much  harder  to ""implement.I d"",  love  to  see  an  option  to  show "" live"", ""dashboards, "",  maps,  or  other  visual  tools  to  publish  in  a  NOC  room,  or  even  just  to  broadcast  in  a  big  monitor  to  allow  multiple  workmates  to  check  that  information.

The  Catalyst  switch  and  the  IOS  software  inside  have  been  great.  We  have  hit  a  few  small  bugs  and  issues  in  the  software  but  a  quick  update  later  they  are  running  strong.The  hardware  is  very  stable.  I  have  only  had  one  or  two  switches  that  had  hardware  issues  in  the  17+  years  of  using  all  kinds  of  different  models.  I  cannot  say  that  about  all  networking  gear. ," Power  supplies,  I  have  had  many  power  supplies  go  bad  over  the  years.  They  are  hot  swap-able  (if  you  have  the  redundant  power  or  power  stack)  and  easily  replaced  but  there  have  been  a  lot  of  bad  ones.Power  over  ethernet  has  been  an  issue  a  couple  of  times.  Since  I  use  these  as  access  layer  I  have  lots  of  utilization  via  phones,  laptops,  cameras,  other  devices.

My experience with Webex Events," My  use-case  is  like  we  have  monthly  town  hall  meetings,  and  participants  will  be  from  across  the  United  States.

"," It  would  be  nice  if  Cisco  Webex  Events  allows  us  to  playback  the  seminar  on  mobile  devices.And  the  booting  time  is  high  compared  to  Cisco  Webex  Meetings.

Webex Events - great for large meetings," In  my  previous  role  at  a  larger  international  research  institute,  I  managed  Cisco  Webex  Events  for  global  and  national  program  meetings  to  share  updates  and  facilitate  internal  learnings.

"," I  prefer  to  use  Cisco  Webex  Events  (as  opposed  to  Webex  Meetings  functions)  because  the  manager  of  the  event  has  more  control  over  participants’  engagement.  For  example,  as  the  manager/owner  of  the  event,  I  can  mute  people  and  restrict  them  from  using  video.I  like  the  overall  platform  as  someone  who  manages  events  for  large  groups.  There  are  two  ways  to  monitor  and  manage  communications:  1)  Q&A  box  and  2)  general  inquiries/comments,  which  can  be  private  or  shared  to  the  entire  group. "," The  video  function  is  a  great  feature,  but  it  would  be  nice  to  have  greater  control  of  the  placement  of  the  video  because  it  can  obscure  the  Power  Point,  or  other  media  shared  on  your  screen.We  often  have  issues  with  connectivity  to  other  countries.

"," In  most  cases,  the  larger  ASR  routers  such  as  the  1006  and  1009s  have  sufficient  capabilities  to  be  used  as  a  Core  network  router.The  smaller  ASRs  such  as  the  1002  devices  are  best  suited  on  the  edge,  capable  of  handling  a  limited  number  of  connections  due  to  the  fixed  chassis. "," The  ASR  1000  series  routers  can,  as  with  most  devices,  improve  with  additional  memory  capacity  and  upgraded  chip  sets  for  faster  processing.There  seems  to  be  limitations  on  the  number  of  routing  sessions  the  smaller  ASR  devices  can  handle,  which  can  be  overcome  with  proper  planning  and  placement  within  the  network.

Cisco - 1852 Controller Devices Constantly Presenting User Frustrations, Cisco  Aironet  1560  Series ," Until  2018,  our  Aironets  were  1560  series,  and  each  was  managed  separately.  We  had  about  9  devices,  3-4  per  floor,  strategically  placed  on  each  floor  to  get  a  good  coverage  map  over  a  three-floor  environment.  Their  coverage  was  greater  than  expected.  With  the  latest  1852  models  we  have,  they  are  managed  by  a  controller,  and  frankly,  the  coverage  is  a  smaller  area,  requiring  more  units.  We  have  worked  with  support  for  months  and  this  is  the  final  outcome  of  all  the  setting  changes  -  we  simply  need  more  devices  to  cover  the  same  area.None  of  the  models  I  have  used  have  needed  reboots.  We  usually  only  reboot  the  devices  annually,  and  they ""don t"",  have  issues  requiring  restarts.With  the  1560  series,  the  connection  strength  was  extremely  consistent.  With  the  new  1852  model,  which  is  managed  by  one  of  the  WAPs  as  a  controller,  it  is  supposed  to  use  smart  technology  to  load  balance  (optional)  and  determine  which  of  the  WAPs  is  appropriate  to  connect  the  requesting  device  to  -  great  idea  -  but  it  does  NOT  work  well. "," With  the  1852  managed  controller  model,  we  find  the  signal  strength  is  constantly  in  flux  for  our  two  different  manufacturer  laptops,  i  Phones,  i  Pads,  Pixel  2  phones,  etc.  In  other  words, ""it s"",  not  device  specific.  We  also  find  that  frequently,  the  controller  (with  load  balancing  on  or  off)  will  often  push  a  laptop  or  phone  off  to  connect  to  a  WAP  down  the  hall  with  a  much  lower  signal  strength  (due  to  distance)  than  the  one  on  the  ceiling  above  our  head. ""It s"",  very  frustrating.The  1852  managed  controller  model  has  much  fewer  options  for  configuration  and  technical  specs  -  there  are  very  few  choices  because  Cisco  has  set  lots  of  defaults  for  you  and  gives  you  no  choice  any  longer.
